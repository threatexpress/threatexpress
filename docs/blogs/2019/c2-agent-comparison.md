# C2 Agent Comparison (AUG2019)

**James Tubberville | August 28, 2019 | Tweet This Post: [:fontawesome-brands-twitter:](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://threatexpress.com/blogs/2019/c2-agent-comparison/&text=Comparison of multiple C2 Agents.)**

![][1]

I was recently asked to perform an evaluation of multiple command and control (C2) agents. Rather than spending an exorbitant amount of time (that could be used building a custom C2) on an evaluation, I decided to perform a quick comparison of several popular C2 agents.

Systems for testing included Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, MacOS 10.14.6, and Windows 10 (Defender, CrowdStrike, Tanium, McAfee, and a custom defense agent) all fully patched and updated as of August 19,2019.

This comparison is in no way a complete review, evaluation, or judgment on the validity of any agent. Rather it is a very quick assessment of my first take on each (think hours not months). I also acknowledge that if a function, feature, or build did not work after two consecutive attempts it was abandoned.

All readers should note that building a C2 agent or framework isn't easy. Building one that can handle the types of actions a true Red Team may perform while avoiding defensive mechanisms or processes and ensuring effective functionality is tough! Kudos to each of the authors!

Note: I’ve identified differences between multi and cross platform. Cross supports some combination of Windows, Linux, and/or Mac natively. Multi indicates the ability to (easily) write agents to support other platforms. (In this context Cross is better :))

### **Sliver**

**Code:** https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver
**License: GNU GPL3**

**Pros:**

- Crossplatform
- Anit-forensics (? Untested)
- Attempts to enforce good OPSEC
- Agents will reconnect if proc crash (within given timeframe)
- Agent info provided during profile generation
- Stable so far (no unvalidated crashes)
- Did not produce any alerts
- Native builds did not flag AV (Defender, CrowdStrike, Tanium. McAfee)

**Cons:**

- In Alpha
- Limited review
- Limited capabilities
- Generating with symbols takes a while (requires additional memory on server)
- Proc crashes if memory overrun (need several GB for generation)

- Traffic looks like legit web (b64 to initial viewing)
- Can be used across platforms
- Alternates callback intervals
- Notes indicate future dev

**Cons:**

- Extremely limited
- Console has limited native functionality
- Looks like a project idea that hasn't taken off quite yet

## **Results**

Of the 12 C2 listed, none are viable for my needs in long-term operations. Several have benefits for short-term OPS; however, drawbacks must be weighed against operational objectives.

Cobalt Strike is extremely useful and viable for Windows based operations or if used in conjunction with a second C2.

If 2 were **required** outside Cobalt Strike, Sliver would be my first and Faction second choices with very specific use cases for each.
