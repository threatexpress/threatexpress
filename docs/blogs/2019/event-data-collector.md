# EVENT DATA COLLECTOR (EDC)

**[James Tubberville][14] | November 12, 2019 | Tweet This Post: [:fontawesome-brands-twitter:](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://threatexpress.com/blogs/2019/event-data-collector/&text=RT Event Data Collector.)**

![][1]

Event Data Collector (EDC) is a very basic django application used to capture data on the fly.

It is primarily designed to facilitate the flow of a cohesive red team by enabling both manual and automated collection of operational activities and information. It's not fancy, was designed in stages to meet the need of the hour, and has had some elements removed to protect multiple organizations.

It is expected only RT members assigned to the operation and those designated as Trusted Agents (TA), White Cell, or Control Cell members with a need-to-know will use EDC.

You can find the latest info, code, and setup instructions on [Github][15].

## General Information

#### Views

Views are based off templates rather than builds. This enables the team to choose what is displayed in the view and what requires viewing the entry detail.

- Info (info): Information about the event
- OPLOG (oplogs) Operator Logs - Log entries of all actions
- Targets (targets): Actioned Targets - Any target asset where actions are performed (succeed or fail)
- Credentials (creds): Obtained Target Credentials - files, mimikatz, keylogging, etc.
- Payloads (payloads): Location for storing pre-made payloads (escalation, c2, peristance, etc.)
- Deconfliction (decon): Deconfliction Data - Basic data! Defensive elements (Blue Teams, SOC, etc.) side should provide more data for verified deconfliction. Note decon is just a subset of oplog data.

**Examples:**

#### URLs

- info/
- oplogs/
- targets/
- creds/
- payloads/
- decon/
- tag/ - quick identification of tagged logs (tag/c2, tag/observation, tag/persistence)
- user/ - list of logs per operator (user/testerld)
- rta/ - Admin Dashboard (change this as desired)

#### Rest Framework

(Requires IsStaff for access)

- eventinfo/
- oplog/
- cred/
- target/
- api-token/ < Generate Key

### Authentication and Authorization

EDC requires an account to be assigned a role for any access. Although individual permissions can be applied, it is highly recommended to use the role based permissions.

#### Roles (Groups)

- Lead: Event lead or manager - Has privileges to all edc actions
- Operator: Operator or keyboarder - Has privileges to most edc actions less some permanent delete
- WhiteCell: Has only view privileges for Info and Deconfliction - Trusted Agent, Observer, Data Scientist, etc.

### Quick Tips

- Tags can be any desired keyword useful to your team. These can be used to create a quick view for your desired case (i.e. identify all tagged findings)

![][12]

- User tokens must be passed for access to the rest framework.
- All views have an associated template (vs. a tables build). Adding or removing fields from view is a simple as adding/removing from the template.
- Some secrets are hidden from view (i.e. the plaintext password is hidden on the creds table but visible in details)
- Setup instructions on github provides AWS S3 and Email Password Reset options
- Anyone can register (assuming it is actually open and avail on www)
  - There are no permissions assigned by default. Login produces no views and no access
  - The deployment should have restricted access (ACL), or be accessible only from VPN, etc.
  - You may optionally restrict registrations to a specific email domain
- The bashrc is recommended for use as it saves terminal logs locally. It also has several simple example functions for submitting data to EDC. These bash examples should be binaries or python execs (client) in your path. The included functions accepts (or if omitted prompts for) entry data, appropriately names and captures a screenshot (if oplog), and submits the entry.

## Use

- Manual entry
